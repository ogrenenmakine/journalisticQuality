10 Surprising Things You Should Put on Your Résumé	3	1	1
Figuring out what to include on your résumé can be a real headache 	2	1	2
Too much information  and you risk overwhelming the reader 	2	1	2
The trick to striking the right balance is including the most effective information  especially things that might catch a hiring manager's eye 	3	1	1
Here are 10 surprising items you might want to include on your résumé 	2	1	1
"Every job seeker wants to find common ground and a connection to the company or hiring manager  said Chris Westfall  a professional development coach and author of ""The New Elevator Pitch"" (Marie Street Press  2012) "	2	1	1
"What better way to make a connection than through the causes that you support?	3	2	1
3 10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905 If you support causes that are not encouraged by your employer  that's something you need to know before you accept the job!"	2	1	1
Don't worry that you'll overwhelm the person reading your résumé with too much detail 	2	2	1
Hiring managers want specific  quantifiable examples of your past successes  not mere job descriptions of past positions you held  said Charles Purdy  senior editor and career-advice expert at Monster com 	2	1	1
Find a way to tell stories of how your past work improved a company's or organization's bottom line  and use those numbers 	2	1	1
The last items you'd think belong on your résumé are the things you did wrong at your last job  but one expert says featuring your failures can actually help you get a job 	1	2	1
One non-intuitive thing employers want to see on a résumé is failure  said Phil Rosenberg  president of reCareered com 	2	2	2
"Employers want to see that you've tried  failed and learned from your failure  all on a prior employer's dime	2	2	2
3 10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905 This demonstrates innovation  willingness to teach risks  [and] faster reaction and response time	2	3	1
3 10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905 It is also a learning experience  and failure teaches success "	2	2	1
Details about your travel experience might seem out of place on a professional résumé  but that's not the case  one recruiting expert says 	2	2	2
I love to see job seekers who have spent a decent amount of time abroad  [whether] for education  employment or volunteer work  said Rachel Dotson  content manager at ZipRecruiter com 	1	3	1
"This type of experience suggests several important things about the candidate	2	2	1
3 10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905 For example  they are not afraid to leave their comfort zone  they are aware and independent  and they have worked in unfamiliar situations with unfamiliar groups	3	3	1 
3 10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905 While there is no guarantee that these characteristics are true of every person who has gone abroad  the experience itself is certainly enough to pique my interest "	1	2	1
Even if you think that some of your past jobs are trivial  one expert says they may still help you get a job 	1	2	2
"Cody Teets  author of ""Golden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers that Began at McDonald's"" (Cider Mill Press  2012) said employers know that working at a fast-food restaurant isn't easy  and it can help a job seeker’s resumé stand out "	2	2	1
Teets  who is now vice president and general manager of McDonald's Rocky Mountain region  said employers value the things that workers learn at their early jobs 	1	2	1
At McDonald's  for example  workers learn to operate as part of a team  to challenge themselves and to roll with the punches  all skills that will come in handy at any job 	2	2	1
Lest you think using a QR code (Quick Response code  or matrix barcode) on your résumé will make you look a little too eager  one hiring expert said  it will actually have the opposite effect 	2	2	1
Even if the QR code might only contain a link to the person's LinkedIn profile  or their phone number  it shows a comfort level [with] and knowledge of technology  Bruce Hurwitz  president and CEO of Hurwitz Strategic Staffing 	2	2	1
Even if potential employees are working on side projects unrelated to the full-time job they are seeking  it may be worthwhile to include those efforts on a résumé  one expert said 	1	1	1
Any kind of side venture  side business or project that could be indirectly related to the full-time work you're pursuing is a good idea  said Dana Leavy-Detrick  small business consultant at Aspyre 	1	2	1
One expert also suggests job candidates should forget about being humble and should brag a bit on their résumés 	1	2	1
"This is particularly true if the talent or drive is directly relevant to the job at hand  but it's also true for applicants who have competed at a high level in other areas	2	1	1
3 10-surprising-things-put-r-sum-154737905 High-performing companies are always looking for an edge in the marketplace  and having a team of competitive and passionate employees on board can provide a significant advantage "	2	3	1
Don't be afraid to ditch the traditional résumé and try something different  one expert says 	1	2	1
One option growing in popularity among many job seekers is a video résumé 	1	1	1
Including a link to a video résumé is a great way to set yourself apart from the crowd and impress hiring managers  said Josh Tolan  CEO of onlinehiring-network  Spark Hire 	1	4	1
If they've carried a sport into college  they've had to work that into a busy schedule and cut into precious free time 	2	1	1
So they're likely to know how to juggle priorities 	1	2	1

2 arrested in art heist at Calif  financier's home	1	1	2
(AP) — Police say they've arrested two suspects and recovered all the paintings stolen in a huge heist from the home of a Southern California financier 	1	1	3
Richard Lewis said in a statement Thursday that most of the paintings were found when authorities served a search warrant on a car stereo store in Pasadena after a tip from local police 	2	1	1
Lewis says the store's manager  45-year-old Jay Jeffrey Nieto  was arrested Wednesday 	1	1	2
The investigation then led to a home in nearby San Gabriel  where police arrested 40-year-old Wilmer Cadiz and recovered four more paintings 	1	1	2
The victim  Jeffrey Gundlach of Santa Monica  returned from a business trip Sept  14 to find that more than a dozen paintings by the likes of Piet Mondrian and Jasper Johns worth a total of about $10 million had been taken 	1	1	2
The 2012 Emmys: Top 5 predictions	2	1	1
"It's time once again for TV's A-list to squeeze into their tuxes and gowns  practice their strategically ""spontaneous"" thank-you speeches  and brave Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet "	3	2	2
On Sunday night  the 64th annual Emmy Awards will air on NBC  with TV's most acclaimed series vying for the glory — and the ratings bump — that comes with the graceful gold statuette 	3	3	2
Unsurprisingly  critics are already second-guessing the night's successes  surprises  and snubs 	3	2	2
Here  5 predictions for the 64th annual Primetime Emmy Awards:	2	1	1
"1  Whatever your predictions  it's going to be an uncharacteristically unpredictable nightWhen Survivor host Jeff Probst wasn't even nominated in the Best Reality Show Host category — an award he's won since the category was created in 2008 — it was a sign that ""something new"" was finally happening with Emmy voters  says Lisa de Moraes at the Washington Post "	3	2	2
"As a result  the Emmys are looking ""particularly treacherous"" to previous winners and prognosticators "	2	1	2
Previous shoo-ins like The Daily Show may be in for an unpleasant surprise on Sunday night 	2	1	2

2  Mad Men's reign as Best Drama might be overAMC's Mad Men is gunning for a record-breaking fifth consecutive Best Drama Emmy  but critically-acclaimed British costume drama Downton Abbey — which aired earlier this year on PBS — could break the streak 	3	2	2
"Historically  says Jill Serjeant at Reuters  ""British imports often do well at U S  awards shows """	2	2	1
Another potential bad omen for Mad Men?	3	1	2
"It ""emerged empty-handed from last weekend's Creative Arts portion of the Emmys "" which honors achievement in costuming and hairstyling — two aspects of Mad Men that have formerly been recognized as strengths "	2	2	2
"3  But Modern Family's reign continues unabatedThere's plenty to like about every show in the Best Comedy category  but ""it's unlikely anything can stop the glorious Modern Family's march to a third straight Emmy "" says TV Guide "	3	2	1
"The only potential spoiler for the ABC sitcom is CBS' The Big Bang Theory  which ""keeps getting better and better as it beefs up the wacky women's roles "" but it's far more likely that the Dunphy family will be adding another trophy to ABC's mantel "	3	2	2
"With three consecutive wins  Cranston is ""the undefeated heavyweight champ"" of the Lead Actor category and his series-best performance in Breaking Bad's fourth season should earn him a fourth trophy "	2	3	1
"And Danes' starring turn in Homeland is ""the indisputable breakout female performance of the year """	2	2	1
Do any of her co-nominees stand a chance?	2	2	1
"Just ""try to find a single Emmy expert predicting anyone other than Danes"" and you'll have your answer "	3	1	2
But will he earn the Emmy he so richly deserves?	2	2	1
"Not likely  says Maria Elena Fernandez  Jim Parsons' ""huge sentimental moment in the finale"" of The Big Bang Theory will earn him a third Emmy award "	3	2	2

The 2012 enthusiasm gap: Are Democrats or Republicans more fired up?	2	2	1
Through most of this year's presidential campaign  the conventional wisdom was that Republican voters were more enthusiastic than their Democratic counterparts 	3	2	1
The reasoning seemed air-tight: As Americans of all stripes grew frustrated with enduring economic pain  conservatives  who despise President Obama  were itching for the chance to replace him in the White House with Mitt Romney  and many of Obama's supporters were growing disillusioned 	3	2	2
A new Gallup poll  however  suggests that over the summer  the tide turned 	1	1	1
In the 12 swing states likely to decide the presidential contest  Gallup says  the parties were equally enthusiastic in June 	1	2	1
Since then  both parties have picked up enthusiasm  as have independents  but Democrats have gained the most 	1	3	1
They now hold a significant lead  with 73 percent of battleground Democrats saying they are very or extremely charged up about voting  compared to just 64 percent of Republicans 	1	1	1
Are Democrats the ones who now hold the enthusiasm edge?	2	2	1
No question 	3	2	1
He's trailing in polls  and voters give him lower marks than Obama on almost every issue 	3	3	2
Now his enthusiasm edge has evaporated 	2	1	2
"What they weren't counting on was that ""disdain for Romney"" makes Democrats ""even more motivated"" to keep Mitt out of the White House ""Democratic"	3	2	2
"Democrats are on an unsustainable sugar high: If you watched the Dems' ""Abortion-Palooza"" of a convention  says Ed Morrissey at Hot Air  you know Obama is going for a big turnout among diehard Democrats instead of trying to win over moderates "	3	2	1
"Obama's poll bounce and enthusiasm burp suggest the strategy ""paid dividends """	3	3	1
"Based on Obama's deflating tracking-poll numbers  though  he won't be able to sustain the energy to keep up with the GOP's steadily surging spirits over the ""two-month grind ahead """	3	2	2
Gallup: Democratic enthusiasm surges in swing states  nationally	2	2	1
It depends how you slice it: Obama's indeed leading among likely voters — 50 percent to 45 percent  according to a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal survey  says Chris Cillizza at The Washington Post 	3	2	1
"Romney still has the advantage  though  among the likeliest voters — ""that slice of the most enthusiastic slice of the electorate """	3	2	2
It's hard to say who the math favors 	3	2	1
"The only certain thing is that in a close race ""small margins matter "" so victory could go to the side that musters more enthusiasm in a couple of swing states ""The"	3	2	1

About 4 Percent Of Children In U S  Households Lived In A Household That Experienced Violent Crime In 2010	1	1	2
WASHINGTON  Sept  19  2012 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- About 2 8 million children or 3 9 percent of all children in U S  households lived in a household in which at least one member age 12 or older experienced nonfatal violent crime in 2010  according to a report released today by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) 	1	1	2
About 6 million fewer children in 2010 than in 1993 lived in a household victimized by violence  a 68 percent decline over the 18-year period  Over a more recent 10-year period (2001–2010)  the number of children living in a household that experienced violence fell about 37 percent 	1	2	2
This BJS report estimates the prevalence of violent victimization among U S  households with children age 17 or younger  The prevalence rate is the percentage of households in which at least one member age 12 or older experienced one or more violent victimizations in a given year  These estimates are an indicator of the extent to which children have direct and indirect exposure to violent victimization 	1	1	2
In 2010  violent crime was about twice as prevalent in households with children (3 6 percent) compared to households without children (1 8 percent)  More children lived in households where a victimization occurred outside the home (1 7 million or 2 4 percent) compared to inside the home (1 2 million or 1 7 percent) 	1	2	2
An estimated 1 1 million children lived in a household that experienced a serious violent crime  which includes rape  sexual assault  robbery and aggravated assault  Nearly 1 8 million children lived in a household that experienced a simple assault 	1	1	3
The special report  Prevalence of Violent Crime among Households with Children  1993–2010 (NCJ 238799)  was written by BJS statisticians Jennifer L  Truman and Erica L  Smith  The full text of the report  related documents and other BJS statistical resources can be found on the BJS website at http://www bjs gov/ 	1	1	1
41-pound cat named Skinny up for adoption in Texas	1	1	1
RICHARDSON  Texas (AP) — Don't be fooled by the name: Skinny the cat is one hefty feline 	3	1	1
And all 41 pounds of her needs a home 	3	1	2
A Dallas-area animal shelter has cared for the 5-year-old orange tabby since getting a call about a stray in a yard about a week ago 	1	1	1
"Kim Chapin with Richardson Animal Services said Friday that Skinny's ""very sweet"" — and the largest cat she's seen in 21 years with the shelter "	2	2	1
Not surprising 	3	1	1
U S  government growth charts show Skinny weighs about as much as the average 4-year-old child 	1	1	1
With advances in smartphone technology and camera resolution  it's now easier than ever to capture quality images with the mobile device you carry everywhere 	1	3	1
The rise of photo editing apps has added to this movement toward mobile photography  which is becoming a burgeoning and reputable art form 	1	1	1
We spoke to five photographers who use their Android devices -- exclusively or in addition to other cameras -- to shoot  edit and share beautiful photos  and they offered some advice for those looking to enter the field 	1	2	1
Shooting with my Droid is my favorite thing to do with my clothes on  Stokes says 	3	3	1
She finds her Android device  with its camera and sharing capabilities  to be a perfect immediate art form 	1	2	1
The more pictures I took  the more I saw what could be achieved  and the more I liked it  she says 	2	3	1
My Android device inspires me with its versatility     and absolutely beautiful color and results  she says 	3	3	1
I use my Android because it fits in my pocket or purse in a way a DSLR just doesn't  she says 	2	1	1
Not having a million settings forces me to think about the photo in a different way 	2	1	1
Since the camera phone is not very adjustable  I try to start out with good lighting so I can focus on framing and composition  she says 	2	1	1
For Tidmore  the benefit of using an Android device extends past its convenient size -- he likes that everything is maintained on one device 	2	2	1
It's being able to do all of my editing  and upload [photos] to a social network  all on my phone no matter where I am  he says 	2	1	1
I have a job where I'm out and about all day  and being able to create on my phone while I should be working is awesome 	2	3	1
Experiment with apps 	2	1	1
"There is no shortage of photography apps in the App Store or Google Play	2	1	1
17 5-mobile-photographers-capturing-world-android-125823258 Spend a lot of time working with different ones until you find your 'style' or something that really clicks with you  he advises "	2	1	1
Other than that  shoot often     and have fun!	3	2	1
Hamelin uses editing apps like UCam Ultra Camera (which allows him to focus easier) and Pixlr-o-matic for filters 	1	1	1
The HTC Desire also includes camera software that creates panoramic photos 	1	1	1
All my pictures taken with my smartphone are made to be seen by my friends that live far away from me [in Belgium]  so I try to put what I feel inside 	3	1	1
"Hamelin suggests that fellow mobile photographers ""look everywhere  shoot  move  shoot again -- the more you take pictures  the more you find what works and what does not """	3	1	1
Convenience is the biggest factor  Mistry says 	3	2	1
She explains that being able to share her photos instantly is another reason why her smartphone's camera comes in handy 	2	2	1
Mistry is an advocate for editing photos  but she advises mobile photographers to be smart about it 	2	1	1
I know there's a lot of backlash against filters on your photos  and I can understand [that] backlash  she says 	2	1	2
"Which is why I say use filters  but don't abuse filters	2	1	1
17 5-mobile-photographers-capturing-world-android-125823258 Don't feel the need to add a filter if your photo doesn't need it	2	1	1

This app is a no-brainer 	2	1	1
Simple and intuitive  Photoshop Express lets you make the necessary adjustments to crop  exposure  color  tint  hue  saturation  contrast and levels with ease 	2	1	1

5 ways Mitt Romney can fix his Ohio problem	3	2	2
The problem for Romney: He's losing Ohio 	3	1	2
"A new Washington Post poll has President Obama up by 8 percentage points in the Buckeye State  and while ""that's on the high end of recent margins "" says Alexander Burns at Politico  ""the trend is unambiguously in the president's favor """	2	3	1
Even with early voting moving up the vote-casting starting gun  Romney can still win Ohio — and the presidential race — but it won't be easy 	2	2	1
"Here are five ways Romney can turn things around and solve his big ""Ohio problem"":"	3	2	2
1  Make his Romney-Ryan bus tour countAs it turns out  this is Ohio week for the Romney campaign — the candidate and running mate Rep  Paul Ryan (R-Wis )	2	1	1
It's the first time in three weeks that Romney and Ryan  a favorite of conservatives  have appeared together  and Romney is pushing an aggressive Ohio-specific attack on Obama letting China cheat at trade 	3	1	2
This is Romney's last best chance to win over his most crucial swing state  says NBC News' First Read team 	4	1	1
If this week's bus tour doesn't move the needle  as the Romney campaign might say  they very well could decide to all but write off the Buckeye State 	3	1	2
2  Convince Ohio voters to like him moreRomney's biggest obstacle in Ohio is that voters there just aren't that into him  says Nate Cohn at The New Republic 	3	1	2
"Since early September  ""Romney's unfavorable ratings exceeded 49 percent in every poll of likely voters "" and his favorable ratings are  on average  7 points lower "	2	2	2
Obama has never been Ohio's favorite son  but it's hard to envision how Romney pulls off a comeback if a majority of voters outright dislike him 	3	1	2
"Whether it's through glowingly positive ads or some other means  ""if Romney is to have any shot at all  he needs to turn around his image over the next month """	3	1	1
"But  drill down another level and you see some differences emerge: 56 percent of Obama voters are ""very"" enthusiastic  versus 46 percent for Romney "	3	3	1
The poll's brutal 8-point Obama lead is based on a Democrat/Republican/Independent sample that skews Democratic: 37/30/30  says Ed Morrissey at Hot Air 	3	1	1
That's a far cry from the [2010] midterm 36/37/28 — but it's not that far off from 2008's 39/31/30 	3	1	1
To win  Romney has to make the electorate look more like 2010 than 2008 	3	1	1
4  Crush Obama in the debatesRomney strategists say the campaign's internal poll numbers are much tighter than the public polls  putting Romney within the margin of error 	3	1	1
But that could mean a 4-point deficit against Obama — about the average of recent polling 	3	1	2
"Team Romney's hope is that they can tighten the race to just a couple of points heading into the first debate  says Politico's Burns  then ""make up the rest of the difference through a combination of strong debate performances and a robust field operation """	3	2	1
"That isn't too different from their national game plan  ""except the stakes are even higher in Ohio """	3	1	1
"5  Give up on Ohio and focus on other statesLook  ""at some point in every election  it becomes clear that certain states regarded as 'tossups' are probably lost causes for one candidate or the other "" says Liz Marlantes at The Christian Science Monitor  and in Ohio  we've perhaps ""reached a point where Romney should just cut his losses and move on "" focusing ""like a laser"" on Florida  Virginia  and the other remaining states ""he can — and  in fact  absolutely must — win """	3	2	2
One proponent of this theory?	1	1	1
"Karl Rove  who pointedly noted on Fox News this week that ""there are 11 different ways to win without Ohio """	2	1	1
"When the man who engineered George W  Bush's 2004 victory on an Ohio-focused strategy declares ""the Buckeye State a lost cause "" says Alec MacGillis at The New Republic  it's probably time to listen "	3	1	2
6 terrifying instances of pets eating their owners	2	1	3
Staring at cute animals can do wonders for your mental health 	2	2	1
But once in awhile  Mother Nature reveals her dark side  and adorable pets revert to their feral ancestries 	2	1	2
A disturbing example: Recently  the grisly remains of an Oregon hog farmer were found in a pig pen where the man was last seen attending to his typically non-violent animals 	2	1	3
And he's not alone 	1	1	1
Here  six horrifying instances of pets eating their owners:	2	1	3
1  PigsFamily members of 69-year-old Terry Vance Garner were shocked to discover the hog farmer's dentures and an undisclosed body part in the family's pig enclosure several hours after Garner went missing 	2	1	2
Authorities think Garner either suffered a heart attack or was knocked over by the 700-pound animals before being killed and eaten 	2	1	3
"His brother describes the self-professed animal lover as a ""good-hearted guy"" whose animals were his life "	2	2	1
2  A hippoLast year  a 40-year-old former Army major was killed in South Africa after being savagely bitten to death by his pet hippopotamus  Humphrey 	1	1	3
The man had adopted the 1 2-ton creature when it was just 5 months old  after the animal was rescued from a flood 	1	2	1
Humphrey's like a son to me  he's just like a human  he said 	2	1	1
There's a relationship between me and Humphrey and that's what some people don't understand 	1	1	1
Experts have since noted that hippos are actually the most dangerous animals in Africa  killing more people each year than lions  elephants  leopards  buffalo  and rhinos combined 	1	1	3
The man had apparently been the caretaker for his mother  who died of dehydration after her son suffered a heart attack 	3	1	3
4  PugsIn 2009  a small pair of pugs in Nebraska survived for two weeks on the deceased corpse of their owner after he shot himself 	1	2	2
"A Humane Society spokesman said the animals were unlikely to suffer any lasting psychological damage because ""they don't have memories like people """	2	2	1
5  Burmese pythonIn 1996  a 19-year-old Bronx man died after being attacked by his pet Burmese python 	1	1	3
It's likely that the 13-foot-long reptile mistook the man for food after it escaped its cage 	3	1	1
The man was found by his neighbors in a pool of blood with the snake coiled around his torso in his apartment building's hallway 	1	1	3
According to the man's brother  the victim had purchased the snake at a local pet store for $300 a few months earlier 	2	1	1
6  Lizards  tarantulas  spiders  and other bugsLoner Voegel  30  lived in 2007 in a small German apartment in the city of Dortmund with a small zoo of more than 200 snakes  geckos  and insects 	1	1	1
Neighbors alerted police after the stink emitting from his home became too unbearable 	1	1	2
It was like a horror movie  says Britain's The Sun 	2	1	2
They found the man's corpse on the sofa with large chunks of flesh missing 	1	1	3
"Giant webs draped him  spiders were all over him	2	1	1

6 ways Mitt Romney can win the first presidential debate	2	3	1
"In fact  ""all sorts of things can happen — most of them bad — when two of the world's most insulated creatures are suddenly thrust into an oppressive atmosphere consisting of a desolate stage  grim-faced inquisitors  a stone-silent live audience  and an invisible American electorate monitoring every blink and stammer """	5	1	3
Whoever comes out ahead  especially in the first debate  will probably win in November 	3	1	1
"Romney's ""had a tough couple of weeks "" but he'll nail Wednesday night's debate and ""this whole race is going to turn upside down come Thursday morning """	4	2	1
Here are six things Romney can do to make Christie's confident — and off-message  for a team that wants to lower expectations — prediction come true:	2	2	1
"1  Romney needs a memorable zingerTeam Romney has come to believe that the debates are about creating ""moments "" and they've ""equipped him with a series of zingers that he has memorized and has been practicing on aides since August "" say Peter Baker and Ashely Parker at The New York Times "	2	2	1
"And ""Mitt can land a tough punch "" as he showed in the GOP primary debates "	3	2	2
"I doubt Romney has ""a zinger for the ages"" in him  says Mark Samburg at the Hartford Courant  but he can surely ""muster up something that we'll still be talking about by Election Day """	3	2	2
2  He must force Obama to lose his coolObama is winning  so he'll want to play it safe  says Chris Cillizza at The Washington Post 	3	1	1
"That was true once  but Romney's ""at his best when his back is to the wall "" says Edward Klein at the New York Post "	3	2	2
"He'll attack just fine  but it's not clear he has ""the skill to exploit Obama's reputation for being sensitive to criticism """	3	2	2
"This whole election may ""come down to whether Romney can get under the president's skin with well-aimed barbs and crack Obama's composure """	4	1	2
"3  He should fact-check the presidentRomney and his allies have been telegraphing that he will use the debate ""to turn himself into a one-man truth squad "" painting Obama ""as someone who can't be trusted to stick to the facts or keep his promises "" says Politico's Kevin Robillard "	4	1	2
That's the right idea  but it's not as easy as it sounds  says Karl Rove at The Wall Street Journal 	3	2	2
"Romney ""can't take on the role of fact-checker-in-chief "" but he ""must call out the president"" on his serial ""untruths"" but without calling him a liar — ""that's too harsh a word that would backfire """	3	2	2
"And remember  ""a dash of humor is worth its weight in gold """	3	2	1
"4  The best strategy is attack  attack  attack""The first debate will be almost exclusively on the economy "" says Eric Pianin at The Fiscal Times  and that gives Romney his best shot to hammer Obama on the deficit  unemployment  and his failure to ""create a more harmonious atmosphere in Washington """	4	2	3
"Being negative ""won't make him more likable "" political analyst Larry Sabato tells The Fiscal Times  but that ship has sailed — ""it is too late to reengineer Mitt Romney """	3	1	2
"At this point  ""his only real chance to break through in the debates is to be relentless in cataloging Obama's weaknesses and prosecuting his case """	3	2	2
"Turning this from a choice into a rejection of Obama ""is the only conceivable way that he wins  barring divine intervention or an October surprise """	3	2	2
"5  Romney should talk about himself and his plansChallenging the president and his record is ""essential "" but it's not enough  says the Hartford Courant's Samburg "	3	2	2
It's time to tell us about Mitt Romney 	2	1	1

Abe  'Argo ' 'Les Mis' jockey for Oscar attention	1	1	1
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Hollywood is in its usual hazy head space when it comes to the Academy Awards race 	2	1	1
"Late prospects include Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln "" with Daniel Day-Lewis as the 16th president  ""The King's Speech"" director Tom Hooper's ""Les Miserables "" the musical adaptation of Victor Hugo's classic that features Hugh Jackman  Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway  ""The Hurt Locker"" director Kathryn Bigelow's ""Zero Dark Thirty "" chronicling the hunt for Osama bin Laden  and ""The Lord of the Rings"" creator Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey "" the first in his three-part ""Rings"" prelude "	1	1	1
"Jackson's three ""Lord of the Rings"" films earned best-picture nominations  and the finale won  ""The Lord of the Rings"" is a heavyweight drama of a fantasy compared to the more playful ""Hobbit "" which could hurt the new trilogy's chances among Oscar voters  who usually lean toward weightier stories "	2	2	2
"But since ""Lord of the Rings "" academy overseers expanded the best-picture category from five nominees to as many as 10 to bring in a broader range of films  including action blockbusters that often get overlooked for awards "	1	2	1
"A big test plays out this season on that effort to make the Oscars more relevant to mainstream moviegoers  Academy bosses cited the best-picture snub of 2008's critical and commercial sensation ""The Dark Knight"" as a key example for expanding the category "	1	2	1
"With reviews nearly as ecstatic as its predecessor's  the Batman finale ""The Dark Knight Rises"" may have a better shot depending on the number of nominees  which will range from five to 10 based on voting results among the nearly 6 000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences "	2	2	1
Or the film may fall victim to the academy's general distaste for fantastical tales  Comic-book adaptations have been money magnets for Hollywood  yet no superhero saga has managed a best-picture nomination so far 	2	1	2
"You don't get into the business of making these kinds of films with any thought toward awards  said Christopher Nolan  director of the current Batman franchise  ""If that's what's of interest to you  then if you look at the odds  you're far better off making a very different kind of film """	2	1	2
"Even ""Avengers"" director Joss Whedon avoids thinking about awards possibilities "	2	1	2
"It would be a lovely thought  but I don't go there in my mind  said Whedon  who was floored when he shared a screenplay Oscar nomination for 1995's ""Toy Story "" ''When we got nominated for 'Toy Story ' it was like  'What are you talking about? Is this a prank?' Anything's possible  but if you start to go down that road  you make yourself crazy """	2	2	2
A late-summer threesome of film festivals — Venice  Toronto and Telluride — premiered many potential contenders for the Oscars  whose nominations come out Jan  10  with the ceremony following on Feb  24 	2	2	1
"Earlier independent releases might creep into the best-picture race  among them the youthful dramas ""Moonrise Kingdom"" and ""Beasts of the Southern Wild "" But that depends on the late-comers premiering over the next three months "	2	1	1
"Along with ""Lincoln "" ''Les Miserables "" ''Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""The Hobbit "" the lineup includes Robert Zemeckis' airline drama ""Flight "" starring Denzel Washington  the Alfred Hitchcock tale ""Hitchcock "" with Anthony Hopkins as the filmmaker  Helen Mirren as his wife and Scarlett Johansson as ""Psycho"" co-star Janet Leigh  Quentin Tarantino's Civil War-era bounty-hunter saga ""Django Unchained "" featuring Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio  and the shipwreck story ""Life of Pi "" from director Ang Lee (""Brokeback Mountain"") "	1	1	1
Contenders rarely talk about their prospects  but they do welcome the fun of the Oscars and the attention they bring to the films 	2	2	1
"I mean  you get to go in a tuxedo and stuff  Blah blah  And you know  if your mother's around  you can take your mother or something  said Bill Murray  a potential best-actor nominee as Franklin Roosevelt in ""Hyde Park on the Hudson "" ''But the cool thing is that people always say there's Oscar buzz  but Oscar buzz only means people are talking about your movie  Which means more people go see your movie  That's all I care about  I just want people to see it """	2	2	1
ACLU asks Supreme Court to reconsider gene patenting case	1	1	1
The Supreme Court had sent back the ACLU's previous lawsuit to the U S  Federal Court of Appeals in Washington  D C 	1	1	1
It asked the appeals court to reconsider an earlier decision upholding the patents in light of a March decision by the high court that rejected a similar case about a patented method for monitoring a patient's blood 	1	1	2
However by a 2-1 vote  the appeals court in August again ruled that companies can obtain patents on genes 	1	1	1
The Supreme Court is not required to take up the case and will likely first give Myriad a chance to respond before deciding whether to hear the case or let the appeals court ruling stand 	1	1	1
In our view  the court of appeals did not fully consider or correctly apply the Supreme Court's most recent and relevant patent law decisions  ACLU attorney Chris Hansen said in a statement 	3	1	1
Myriad did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the ACLU action 	1	1	1
The genes in question  known as BRCA1 and BRCA2  can be used to detect risk of breast and ovarian cancer and to help inform treatment options 	1	3	1
Women who test positive using Myriad's gene test  called BRACAnalysis  have an 82 percent higher risk of developing breast cancer and a 44 percent higher risk of ovarian cancer in their lifetimes 	1	1	3
The patents give Myriad exclusive rights to perform tests on the two genes 	1	1	1
The ACLU suit argues that the exclusivity allows Myriad to set the cost of such testing and makes it impossible for women to access tests that provide more comprehensive information about their genes or get a second opinion about their results 	1	1	2
Afghan inside attack kills 2 Americans  2 Afghans	1	1	4
KABUL  Afghanistan (AP) — An Afghan soldier turned his gun on American troops at a checkpoint in the country's east  killing two Americans and two fellow members of Afghanistan's army in a shooting that marked both the continuance of a disturbing trend of insider attacks and the 2 000th US troop death in the long-running war  officials said Sunday 	2	1	4
The string of insider attacks is one of the greatest threats to NATO's mission in the country  endangering a partnership key to training up Afghan security forces and withdrawing international troops 	1	1	3
Initial reports indicate that a misunderstanding happened between Afghan army soldiers and American soldiers  Shahid said 	3	1	2
He said investigators had been sent to the site to try to figure out what happened 	2	1	1
It was not clear if the assailant was killed 	2	1	3
The attack happened about 5 p m  in Sayd Abad district  Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Gen  Zahir Azimi said in an emailed statement 	1	1	3
Afghan soldiers and policemen — or militants in their uniforms — have gunned down more than 50 foreign troops so far this year  eroding the trust between coalition forces and their Afghan partners 	2	1	4
An equal number of Afghan policemen and soldiers also died in these attacks  giving them reason as well to be suspicious of possible infiltrators within their ranks 	2	1	4
The attacks are taking a toll on the partnership between international and Afghan forces  prompting the U S  military to restrict operations with small-sized Afghan units earlier this month 	3	1	2
The close contact — with coalition forces working side by side with Afghan troops as advisers  mentors and trainers — is a key part of the U S  strategy for preparing the Afghans to take the lead in security operations as the U S  and other nations prepare to pull out their last combat troops at the end of 2014  just 27 months away 	2	1	1
The number of American military dead reflects an Associated Press count of those members of the armed services killed inside Afghanistan since the U S -led invasion on Oct  7  2001 	2	1	3
S Africa stocks lose ground as resources hit	1	1	2
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African stocks edged down 0 5 percent on Friday  as investors hit Harmony Gold on the stronger rand and Anglo American Platinum on concerns over labour unrest 	1	1	2
I think the rand played a key factor here today  said Sasha Naryshkine  analyst at asset manager Vestact 	2	1	1
It firmed up and has hurt gold and platinum stocks 	1	1	2
The benchmark Top-40 index declined 0 46 percent to 31 934 87 	1	1	2
It hit a record high of 32 381 54	1	2	1
last week 	1	1	1
The broader All-share index dropped 0 42 percent to 36 206 33 	1	1	2
It hit a record high earlier this week 	1	2	1
The rand currency rose nearly 1 percent on Friday 	1	2	1
Harmony Gold tumbled 4 8 percent to 74 41 rand 	1	1	2
The bulk of its production comes from South Africa  making Harmony the most sensitive of major gold producers to movements in the currency 	1	1	2
Shares of Anglo American Platinum fell 1 8 percent to 440 79 rand 	1	1	2
Wildcat strikes continued at four of the company's mines on Friday  with less than 20 percent of the workforce reporting for duty 	1	1	2

S African mine labour strife halts slide in chrome	1	1	2
LONDON (Reuters) - The impact of South African mine labour unrest has spread beyond precious metals to UG2 chrome ore  a by product of platinum and key ingredient in stainless steel  with output cuts putting a floor under prices after four months of decline 	2	1	2
In recent months  violent labour unrest over pay has disrupted production at some of the largest South African platinum mines  including those owned by Anglo American Platinum  Lonmin and Aquarius Platinum 	1	1	2
Although disputes at some south African shafts have been resolved  strikes are in full force at others and continuing to spread  raising worries that prolonged disruptions might hit production further 	1	1	3
So far strikes have cut output of UG2 chrome ore by about 150 000-250 000 tonnes  market players said  a significant enough amount to have an effect on prices  even in an over supplied market 	2	1	2
The strikes in Lonmin have removed about 100 000 tonnes a month of UG2 which is no small amount  said a European ferrochrome trader  adding an additional 50 000-80 000 tonnes have been cut due to strikes at other mines 	3	1	2
The reduced output has stemmed a 4-month price decline in ferrochrome - the processed product of chrome  with projections now looking at rising values even though economic slowdown has depressed demand from stainless steel makers  industry players said 	2	2	2
Prices of high carbon ferrochrome in Europe stand at around $1 02-1 10 per lb in Europe  with low carbon material selling at between $2 05 and 2 10 per lb 	1	1	1
Prices have fallen by around 10 percent in the last four months 	1	2	2
There is an output reduction although it is difficult to assess how much  this has already been priced in platinum but not in the chrome and ferrochrome yet  an industry source said 	2	1	2
Producers can still rely on stocks for now but these stocks are not been replenished and when the Chinese come back to the market after the National Day holiday next week prices will likely rise especially if the problems in South Africa continue 	3	2	3
He estimated that ferrochrome spot prices will move up  pushing the European benchmark price up $0 05-0 10/lb to about $1 20-1 30/lb in the first quarter next year 	2	2	2
Adding to supply concerns  works at some chrome mines  including the Xstrata's Kroondal mine and the Samancor Western chrome mine were also briefly suspended earlier this month due to increased protests in the area 	1	1	2
In the meantime  South African ANC renegade Julius Malema  who has backed wildcat miners' strikes  said he would visit a platinum mine run by Impala  a large platinum and UG2 chrome ore producer  on Thursday  to press for a wage strike there 	1	2	2
While the loss of output is expected to be significant  its effect is likely to be only temporary as platinum miners should quickly make up for the lost supply once operations restart  market players said 	3	2	2
UG2 chrome ore  which has a lower chrome content compared to chrome ore  was considered waste by platinum miners until a few years ago 	1	1	1
Although it is difficult to estimate South Africa's UG2 chrome ore production as stocks figures are not available  domestic consumption and exports stood at 2-3 million tonnes per annum in the last three years 	1	1	1
Traders said longer-term plans by firms to process more UG2 chrome from South Africa are likely to put pressure on prices from next year when new capacity is expected to come on stream 	1	2	2
That's one of the sources where we could see more material coming from next year and it can have a negative impact on chrome (prices) considering the stainless steel market is still pretty awful at the moment  a second European trader said 	3	2	3

Air Force Launching Secretive X-37B Space Plane in October  Could Land in Fla 	1	1	1
The U S  military's hush-hush robotic X-37B space plane is slated to blast off again next month  Air Force officials say 	1	2	1
The mission will test the robotic spacecraft's reusability and may eventually land on the Florida runway once used for NASA space shuttles 	1	1	1
The X-37B space plane's next mission — called Orbital Test Vehicle-3  or OTV-3  because it is the program's third-ever spaceflight — is scheduled to launch aboard an Atlas 5 rocket from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) sometime in October 	1	1	1
Preparations for launch at Cape Canaveral have begun  said Major Tracy Bunko at the Pentagon’s Air Force press desk 	1	1	1
We are on track to launch OTV-3 next month  however  the exact date remains subject to change based on range conditions  weather  etc 	1	2	2
But the focus remains on testing vehicle capabilities and proving the utility and cost-effectiveness of a reusable spacecraft  Bunko told SPACE com 	1	1	1
Bunko said in an earlier communiqué that this third flight will use the same X-37B spacecraft that flew the first test flight  the OTV-1 mission  back in 2010 	1	1	1
It launched into orbit on April 22  2010  and then landed on Dec  3 of that year  zooming in on autopilot over the Pacific Ocean and gliding down onto a specially prepared runway at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California 	1	1	1
A different X-37B vehicle made a similar Vandenberg touchdown this past June 16  having stayed in orbit for 469 days on its OTV-2 mission 	1	1	1
The X-37B program is being run by the U S  Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office 	1	1	1
The two space planes — which are 29 feet (8 8 meters) long and 15 feet (4 5 m) wide  with a payload bay about the size of a pickup truck bed — were built by Boeing Government Space Systems 	1	1	1
While they're sparing with details about the X-37B program  Air Force officials say the vehicles enable them to test out how new technologies perform in space 	2	3	1
“One of the most promising aspects of the X-37B is it enables us to examine a payload system or technology in the environment in which it will perform its mission and inspect them when we bring them back to Earth ” Bunko said 	2	3	1
“Returning an experiment via the X-37B OTV enables detailed inspection and significantly better learning than can be achieved by remote telemetry alone ”	2	2	1
The prospect of a returning the robotic space plane to the KSC landing strip — which was used by NASA's now-retired space shuttle fleet — is seen as a cost-saving measure 	2	3	1
We are also considering consolidating landing  refurbishment and launch operations at KSC or CCAFS in an effort to save money  Bunko said 	1	3	1
"“We are seeking to leverage previous space shuttle investments and are investigating the possibility of using the former shuttle infrastructure for X-37B OTV landing operations "" Bunko added "	1	2	1
Those investigations are in an early state  and any specifics will not be known for some time  but could potentially be used as early as for the landing of OTV-3 	1	2	2

Al Qaeda in North Africa making millions kidnapping: U S 	2	1	3
BERLIN (Reuters) - Islamist militants are increasingly funding themselves through kidnapping  with al Qaeda's north African wing likely to have brought in tens of millions of dollars in ransoms in the past few years  a senior U S  Treasury official said 	3	1	4
The United States estimates militant organizations received $120 million in ransoms over the past decade  including to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in recent years  said David Cohen  undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence 	4	1	3
"Kidnapping for ransom was an ""urgent threat""  particularly in the Sahel  a belt of land spanning nearly a dozen of the world's poorest nations on the Sahara's southern rim  Cohen told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday "	3	1	3
Cohen said the average ransom had gone up consistently over the years and was in the range of $5 million per payment 	2	1	2
AQIM emerged out of Algeria's civil conflict and has expanded south into the Sahara  raising its profile in recent years with hit-and-run attacks and kidnappings of westerners 	2	1	3
Militant groups have benefited from lapses in security across the region as countries transition from years of dictatorship to more democratic government 	2	2	3
Cohen  on a week-long trip that includes stops in Britain  France  Germany and Italy  said he was talking with other governments in the hope of developing a unified approach to the kidnapping problem 	2	3	2
While the U S  government has a policy of not paying ransoms  some European governments do so 	2	2	2
Talks were centered around steps to prevent kidnappings happening in the first place  the handling of hostage situations when they occur  and the tracing of financial flows when ransoms are paid  Cohen said 	2	3	2
Iran and Syria were the other main topics of discussion with his European counterparts  he said	2	2	2
"Sanctions against Syria over the past 18 months had taken a ""significant bite"" out of the government's finances  he said  declining to give figures "	2	3	1
"You have a situation where the Syrian government is spending at a greater rate	3	1	1
30 al-qaeda-north-africa-making-millions-kidnapping-u-155011734 They are spending on security needs  on providing subsidies to their citizens  at the same time that the revenue side of the ledger is being significantly restrained "	3	2	1
Alaska militia member receives 5-years prison term	1	1	2
FAIRBANKS  Alaska (AP) — A member of an Alaska militia group was sentenced Monday to five years in federal prison for his conviction on weapons charges in a case involving others convicted of conspiring to kill government officials 	1	1	2
Coleman Barney of North Pole held his head in his hands and sniffled loudly while he waited for U S  District Judge Robert Bryan to impose the sentence Monday in Anchorage 	1	1	2
I think you got into some real bad stuff here  and this sentence reflects it  Bryan said 	2	1	2
Barney  38  and two other defendants have been in custody since their March 2011 arrests  The judge said Barney's time already served will count toward his term 	1	1	2
"Barney was convicted in June of conspiracy to possess unregistered silencers and grenades  and possession of an unregistered 37 mm projectile launcher loaded with a ""hornet's nest"" anti-personnel round that contained rubber pellets  Bryan's sentence was five years for each of the two charges  with the terms running concurrently "	1	1	2
Barney's attorney  Tim Dooley  said he will appeal 	1	1	1
Schaeffer Cox  the leader of the Fairbanks-based Alaska Peacemaker Militia  and another militia member  Lonnie Vernon  are scheduled for sentencing Nov  19 on more serious charges  including conspiracy to commit murder  Members of the tiny militia claimed the group would protect families and property if the federal government collapsed 	1	1	2
A jury at the men's trial deadlocked on a murder conspiracy charge against Barney and acquitted him of two other charges: possession of hand-grenade parts that Cox had loaded into Barney's trailer as Cox prepared to move out of Alaska  and a count of carrying firearms during a crime of violence 	1	1	2
"Before he was sentenced  Barney apologized for making poor choices and decisions  A member of the Mormon church  he said he loved his country and that the militia started out as a group of ""wonderful Christian men"" who wanted to protect their families in case of a collapse  He said he got caught up in the hype and said things he didn't mean "	1	2	1
Barney asked the judge to let him go back to his family 	1	1	1
"There won't ever be any problems with me  he said  ""I'm not a violent man """	1	2	1
Prosecutors had sought a 10-year sentence  saying Barney knew about the murder conspiracy  even discussing it at length with Cox and others 	1	1	2
"Barney was a confidante of Cox and then tried to minimize his actions  according to Assistant U S  Attorney Yvonne Lamoureux  She noted there was no dispute that Barney is a family man and a hard worker  ""which makes it all the more difficult to understand how he got to this point """	2	2	2
Dooley said prosecutors were trying to sentence Barney for things he wasn't convicted of  He pushed for a sentence of time served or house arrest 	1	1	2
Beyond that would be corruption of justice  Dooley said 	2	1	2
"Authorities have said the men advocated the ""241"" retaliation plan  which stood for ""two-for-one"" — killing or kidnapping two officials for any member of Cox' group who might be killed or arrested  an event that never happened  During its investigation  the FBI used an informant to infiltrate the group  He recorded more than 100 hours of conversations "	1	1	2
The plot arose after Cox was charged with misdemeanor weapons misconduct  He represented himself at a pretrial hearing  where he rejected the Alaska court system as a legitimate judiciary  Cox said he would not attend another hearing until the court system explained its authority over him 	1	1	2
A warrant was issued for his arrest when he failed to appear for trial in that case in February 2011  Until his arrest  Cox went into hiding with his family at Barney's home  prosecutors said 	1	1	2
'Alcohol enemas': A frightening new hazing trend?	1	1	2
The thing is  the 20-year-old student hadn't been drinking  exactly 	2	1	1
University officials were appalled 	1	1	2
Shock would not be an [overstatement]  says Tim Rogers  vice chancellor of student life 	2	1	2
What are alcohol enemas  and how popular have they become?	1	1	1
What  exactly  is an alcohol enema?Unfortunately  it's pretty much what it sounds like: A tube is inserted in the rectum and alcohol is poured directly into the colon 	2	1	2
"A more colloquial name is ""butt chugging """	1	1	1
"It isn't  apparently  a pain-free way to get blitzed: The student who was admitted to the hospital was ""extremely intoxicated and showed signs of physical and possible sexual assault "" the police report says "	2	1	4
And this gets you drunk?Yes  and fast 	2	1	1
That's what makes alcohol enemas so dangerous  gastroenterologist Dr  Preston Stewart tells CNN 	1	1	3
Our stomachs and livers use an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase to break down alcohol and make it less toxic  but booze enters the bloodstream unfiltered when it's poured into the gastrointestinal tract 	1	1	2
Boredom or curiosity may also have driven the enema recipients  Dr  Aaron White  at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)  tells CNN 	2	1	1
In the past year or so there have been several stories about young people finding unique ways to get alcohol in their bodies  in part because they think it will prevent vomiting and hangovers 	1	2	2
But throwing up excess alcohol  he notes  is one way your body keeps you alive 	1	2	2
Was this a hazing incident?The UT chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha was cited for hazing in 2008  but the university thinks this was just a high-risk boozing incident 	2	1	2
The student isn't new to the university or the fraternity  and hazing is usually associated with pledging 	1	1	2
"How common is ""butt chugging""?Hard to say  we don't have reliable specific numbers "	3	1	1
More generally  about 1 825 college students 18 to 24 die each year from alcohol-related injuries  according to NIAAA figures 	1	1	4
"It's not uncommon to hear of a new exotic routes to intoxication — besides ""butt-chugging "" thrill-seekers have been known to insert vodka-soaked tampons into the vagina or anus  or indulge in ""vodka eyeballing """	2	1	4
And it's not just college students: A Texas man died in 2004 after his wife gave him a sherry enema 	1	1	3
"Alcohol enemas are ""extraordinarily dangerous "" says the NIAAA's White  ""but people shouldn't get the impression that it's a widespread phenomenon """	2	1	3
Alexandra Kogut: Murdered College Student Left Ominous Last Tweet	2	1	3
Even though murdered college freshman Alexandra Kogut was starting college in a different town from her older boyfriend  the two kept in touch with playful Twitter messages anticipating each others' visits 	2	1	3
"On Sept  2  Clayton Whittemore  a 21-year-old student at Utica College  tweeted at his girlfriend: "" Saturday can't come sooner enough """	3	2	2
So excited for  Whittemore21 to come to Brockport Saturday and bring me half moons  Kogut wrote in September  according to the Utica Observer Dispatch 	3	2	1
Her account has since been taken down 	1	1	1
But one ominous last Tweet suggests something went wrong during their reunion very early Saturday morning  just hours before Whittemore allegedly beat Kogut to death 	2	1	3
Should've known  she wrote at 12:13 a m 	2	1	1
Prosecutors believe the popular freshman at the State University of New York Brockport campus was murdered early Saturday morning by Clayton Whittemore  21  who had apparently been visiting for the weekend 	3	1	3
Authorities said Kogut's mother became concerned when her daughter did not answer her phone and requested campus police perform a welfare check 	2	1	2
During that check  campus police found the communication major dead in her room at McLean Hall early Saturday morning 	2	1	3
She appeared to have suffered severe trauma to her upper body  said Robert Kehoe of the Brockport Campus Police Department 	3	1	3
Authorities caught up with Whittemore  who attends Utica College  at a service station in the town of Dewitt  about 110 miles east of Brockport early Saturday morning 	1	1	2
It's tragic when anyone loses their life  Kehoe told ABC News affiliate WHAM-TV 	2	1	3
Students and staff were notified of the death via email  social media and a message posted on the school's website 	1	1	2
Kogut's family released a statement thanking the community for their support and asking for privacy during their time of grief 	2	1	3
Her lovely and sweet demeanor was truly infectious and she will forever be missed 	4	5	1
Whittemore remains in the custody of the Monroe County Sheriff's Office 	1	1	2
He is due back in court for a preliminary hearing Thursday afternoon 	1	1	1

"Amazon seeks to throw out Apple ""app store"" advertising claim"	1	1	2
"The claim is part of a March 2011 trademark lawsuit in which Apple  which this year became the world's largest company ever by market value  accused Amazon of misusing its ""App Store"" name to solicit developers for a mobile software download service "	2	1	2
It said this change could have contributed to confusion among consumers 	2	1	2
"But in a filing on Wednesday with the U S  District Court in Oakland  California  Amazon said the term ""app store"" has become so generic that its use could not constitute false advertising "	2	1	1
Apple presumably does not contend that its past and current CEOs made false statements regarding to those other app stores to thousands of investors in earnings calls  Amazon said 	3	1	2
To the contrary  the use of the term 'app store' to refer to stores selling apps is commonplace in the industry 	3	1	1

American Alan Gross  jailed in Cuba  may have cancer: lawyer	2	1	3
HAVANA (Reuters) - Alan Gross  the American government contractor jailed in Cuba for crimes against the state  could be suffering from an untreated cancer  according to an independent review of his medical records  his U S  lawyer said on Tuesday 	3	1	3
Gross has a potentially life-threatening medical problem that has not been adequately evaluated to modern medical standards  U S -based radiologist Alan Cohen said in a statement released by Gross attorney Jared Genser 	3	1	3
"As Gross has lost 105 pounds (47 kg) since his arrest in December 2009  Cohen concluded Gross's right-shoulder mass is in urgent need of proper medical evaluation  including an MRI ""and potentially a biopsy  preferably in a facility in the United States  immediately """	2	1	4
"The Cuban government had no immediate comment on Cohen's statement  but previously has said Gross was in ""normal"" health "	2	2	2
Gross  jailed in Cuba since December 3  2009  is serving a 15-year sentence for illegally providing Internet equipment and service to Cuban Jewish groups under a U S  program promoting political change that the Cuban government considers subversive 	3	2	3
His arrest stalled a brief period of progress in U S -Cuba relations that have been mostly bad since Cuba's 1959 revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power and turned the island communist 	2	2	3
The latest doctor's report was seized upon by Genser and Judy Gross  who have been demanding that Cuba allow an independent medical expert to examine Gross 	1	1	2
Cuban government doctors are either guilty of gross professional negligence or they are intentionally hiding what could be a lethal condition  Genser said 	3	1	4
"President Castro  I beg you not to let my husband die on your watch	4	1	4
37 american-alan-gross-jailed-cuba-may-cancer-lawyer-052226211 Your country claims to have such a wonderful health care system - yet why have your doctors misdiagnosed him and failed to order the right tests to determine what is actually happening?"	4	1	4
Please let us have Alan diagnosed by a doctor of his choosing before it is too late  she said 	3	1	3
Cuba prides itself on its medical system  which provides free care to all  but suffers from equipment and medicine shortages the government blames on the long-standing U S  trade embargo against the communist island 	3	2	2
Gross has asked Cuba to let him go home for two weeks to visit his mother and daughter  both of whom have cancer 	2	2	2
Cuba has said it proposed talks with the United States about resolving the Gross case but has received no answer 	2	2	2
It said that Gross could be in a prison but is serving his time in a military hospital 	2	2	2
Americana revisited: Rockwell's models reuniting	1	1	1
ARLINGTON  Vt  (AP) — Don Trachte's cowlick has been tamed  Mary Hall is no longer a towhead  Butch Corbett is still thin  but not the beanpole he once was  And Tom Paquin's carrot top is thinner and grayer 	4	2	1
Rockwell captured scenes of everyday life in his paintings and illustrations for covers of Saturday Evening Post  the Boy Scouts and its publication Boys' Life  art now considered the very definition of Americana  He would pay his neighbors $5 a pop to appear in Hallmark cards  in calendars and on magazine covers that ended up gracing the coffee tables and littering the tree houses of millions of magazine readers young and old 	1	2	2
"The Saturday Evening Post came out weekly  and we couldn't wait to get it to see what was on the cover  said Hall  who posed for Rockwell four times  ""You could always recognize who it was """	2	2	1
An estimated 300 people from the area modeled for Rockwell during his 14 years in the southern Vermont town  Of the 70 or so still living  the oldest is 93 (he can't make it to the reunion)  Many still live in and around Arlington 	1	3	2
The former models have gotten together before  but this weekend is special  They have been invited to view a new gallery of Rockwell prints and memorabilia that is taking the place of a recently closed Rockwell museum  The new owners are treating them to a turkey lunch presented in the style of Rockwell's famous painting of an excited family gathered for Thanksgiving dinner 	2	3	1
"I think it's important that the models keep the tradition of the image that Vermont  Arlington in particular  was important in Norman Rockwell's biography  That while he lived in Arlington he did his best work  probably     and his local models were Arlington people  said James ""Buddy"" Edgerton  82  who lived next door to Rockwell  his wife and three sons and modeled for him at least a dozen times "	2	3	1
Rockwell was a full-fledged member of the town  attending school basketball games and square dances  and had a great sense of humor  his neighbors recall  But as one of America's foremost artists  he could be as precise as any high-fashion photographer 	3	3	1
He would first have the models photographed and then would sketch a drawing  Sometimes the session in his studio took minutes  sometimes several hours  He always had a pipe in his mouth  and he joked around with the kids to make them comfortable 	1	3	1
"Rockwell knew just what he wanted  instructing the children to sit or stand in certain positions with particular expressions and to wear certain clothing  often providing Scout uniforms  or in one case  the velvet outfit that Hall wore for the cover of an edition of the book ""Little Lord Fauntleroy """	1	1	1
"Edgerton — who went on to write the memoir ""The Unknown Rockwell: A Portrait of Two American Families "" about a farm boy growing up next door to the Rockwells — modeled for his neighbor at least a dozen times  mostly as a Scout  with his image published in four calendars "	1	1	1
"The last time he modeled was in 1964  after Rockwell had moved about 65 miles away to Stockbridge  Mass   now home to the Norman Rockwell Museum  Edgerton appeared as a Scoutmaster with his son  then 9  as a Scout in a painting called ""Growth of a Leader "" showing four profiles of a Scout from a child to an adult with a graying sideburn — much like Edgerton has today "	1	2	1
"He was wonderful guy  Edgerton said  ""He made you feel you were the most important person in the world when you were doing it """	3	4	1
America's booming tattoo economy: By the numbers	1	1	1
This week  the American Medical Association published what's considered to be the first scientific survey of tattoo removal  detailing which tattoos are hardest to remove (blue ink) and what factors reduce the odds of erasing the damn thing (smoking) 	3	1	1
The report is a sure sign that tattoos — once the province of rock stars and ne'er-do-wells — have become thoroughly mainstream 	2	1	1
Here  a numerical guide to America's tattoo obsession:	1	1	1
$2 3 billion Annual revenue of the tattoo industry	1	1	1
23 Percent of women who have a tattoo	1	1	1
36 Percent of 18-to-25-year-olds who have a tattoo	1	1	1
38 Percent of 30-to-39-year-olds who have a tattoo	1	1	1
11 Percent of 50-to-64-year-olds who have a tattoo	1	1	1

America's unexpected addition of 386 000 more jobs: 4 takeaways	2	1	1
The Labor Department added a new wrinkle to the presidential campaign on Thursday  when it reported that the economy actually added 386 000 more jobs than previously thought from April 2011 to March 2012 	2	1	1
GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney's campaign said the rosier figures don't change anything 	2	1	1
"There are 23 million Americans struggling to find work right now  Romney adviser Kevin Madden said  ""and the president has nothing more to offer than tax hikes and more regulations """	2	1	2
What exactly does the unexpected uptick in employment figures really mean?	3	1	1
Here  four significant points to consider:	3	1	1
"1  We shouldn't be shocked by these revisionsThis doesn't mean companies went ""on a previously undetected hiring spree "" says Ben Casselman at The Wall Street Journal "	3	1	1
The Labor Department just got access to better data 	1	2	1
"That's ""more accurate — but much less timely """	2	2	2
2  And should treat the monthly jobs reports with a grain of saltPoliticians and economists always pounce when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly jobs report  says Brad Plumer at The Washington Post 	3	1	1
"But this latest revision ""suggests that we could all probably stand"" to cool it a bit "	2	1	1
"Why put so much emphasis on numbers that are ""almost never the last word on how the economy’s actually performing""?"	3	1	1
"In 2009  ""the economy actually lost 902 000 more jobs than the monthly jobs reports had initially suggested """	2	1	2
In 2011  it turns out the jobs reports underestimated the number of jobs being created by an average of 67 000 jobs per month 	2	1	1
3  This deprives Romney of a key talking pointThis news is great for America  but terrible for Mitt Romney  says Steve Benen at MSNBC 	2	2	2
"He probably was looking forward to arguing in next week's debate ""that the economy hasn't added any new jobs during Obama's term """	3	1	2
"That talking point ""was always ridiculous "" given that employment was already plummeting downward when Obama took office  making it grossly unfair to pin early 2009 job losses on him "	4	1	2
"Now  though  Romney's ""talking point is off the table entirely "" because the new figures mean the economy has added a net total of 125 000 jobs on Obama's watch  instead of losing 261 000 as previously estimated "	3	2	1
"4  But the GOP still has plenty of ammo against ObamaThe fact that the Labor Department just ""magically"" created a bunch of jobs ""changes nothing "" says Conn Carroll at The Washington Examiner "	4	2	2
"The job market today is still ""incredibly weak "" and it ""has gotten weaker the past two months """	2	1	2
Not only that  but the employment news was offset by a fresh flurry of scary economic data — durable good orders fell in August by the most since the recession  and second-quarter economic growth was downgraded from 1 7 percent to 1 3 percent 	3	1	2
AMR seeks pilot talks  union wants it in writing	2	1	1
DALLAS (AP) — American Airlines officials say they want to resume contract negotiations with pilots  but the union wants a written invitation 	2	1	1
The Allied Pilots Association said late Sunday night that it hasn't met with management  no talks are scheduled  and no deal is imminent 	2	1	2
The union says maintenance requests cover safety issues and sick days are running close to normal 	2	1	1
A company spokesman said last week that American was ready to resume negotiations 	2	2	1
"The union says it needs the request in writing to ""establish a protocol"" for talks "	2	1	1
Analysis: Bomb ticks on EADS pact as politics cloud merger	4	1	3
With firms already racing an October 10 deadline to overcome growing political obstacles  fears over what would happen as core EADS industrial partners seek to disinvest have set the fuse on further discord within months if BAE talks break down 	4	1	3
After acting as a power-sharing mechanism for over a decade  the pact which balances national interests via stakes held by the French state  French conglomerate Lagardere and German engineer Daimler will be wound up if EADS and BAE forge the world's largest defense company 	4	2	2
But so fragile has the partially confidential pact become  as Lagardere and Daimler prepare to sell stakes to concentrate on core businesses  that there are doubts whether the status quo would hold for more than a year even if the British merger talks fail and EADS tries to return to business as usual 	3	1	2
That could promote fresh arguments between French and German politicians over control of one of Europe's strategic companies  without the rights or guarantees the pact now offers 	3	1	2
"Whether the deal goes ahead or not  the shareholder pact is going to disappear at some point	2	1	2
42 analysis-bomb-ticks-eads-pact-politics-cloud-merger-193310637--finance The rights are fragile and provisional  said a person with knowledge of the safeguards "	3	1	2
A spokesman for EADS declined comment 	1	1	2
It shares control with Lagardere  which has 7 5 percent but also represents the French government's 15 percent through the 12-year-old share pact 	1	2	1
The situation mirrors a Bastille Day impasse in 1999 when French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin vetoed the creation of EADS without French state shares 	3	1	2
Today Germany wants its own role  beyond any influence it may have tried to exert through Daimler 	3	1	1
Negotiating in complete secrecy  EADS' founders managed 13 years ago to square the circle with an unusual pact 	3	2	1
A system of boxes surrounding the French government investment left civil servants some powers while giving Daimler and Lagardere final say on key matters like board nominations 	2	2	2
It is the vulnerability of these core arrangements - both companies seem keen to cash in their stakes - as much as short-term market or regulatory pressure  that could eventually persuade quarrelling governments and industrialists to cling together to find a way out of the current deadlock 	4	2	2
The governments face a dilemma  said a person who has participated directly in similar European-wide negotiations 	2	1	2
They can hold onto rights which are provisional and subject to Daimler and Lagardere remaining  or they can exchange these rights against permanent ones enshrined in a special share 	3	1	1
If the BAE deal falls through  shareholders attuned to the next opportunity for structural change will at once set their calendars to the first flight of Europe's newest passenger jet  the Airbus A350  which is scheduled for the middle of 2013 	3	1	1
From the time Europe's first carbon jetliner takes off  speculation is likely to swirl around the 7 5-percent stake held by Lagardere  whose chief executive has committed to stay on board EADS only until the risky plane project is finalized 	4	1	2
The timing of a sale has been left deliberately vague  with the plane's first delivery not expected until the second half of the following year and market prices certain to play a role 	3	1	2
When it does happen  events could cascade quickly inside the pact which is a Russian doll of nested agreements  according to industry specialists and a Reuters analysis of available texts 	4	1	2
Secondly  a frustrated Daimler has for months been seeking ways to sell some of its shares to the German state without blowing up the very Franco-German pact it helped design  it is unlikely to pass up any chance to sell when Lagardere opts out 	4	1	3
After a decade that saw significant birth pangs to the A380 superjumbo  both companies want to focus on core businesses - notably media for Lagardere and vehicle making for Daimler 	4	2	2
Even without the first rule  the larger pact would collapse once Daimler fell below a 10-percent holding in EADS unless the French government also were to sell some of its shares  which it has so far refused to do 	3	1	3
But other special rights for pact members  like helping shape acquisitions or industrial strategy  would vanish  leaving the government with a strake but less clout than before 	3	2	2
Worse  past divisions have filtered into the company hampering governance 	3	1	2
Yet skilful compromise would be needed more than ever to prevent a dash for state shares backfiring  for example by accidentally triggering a mandatory offer for the whole of EADS 	4	1	3
With all this at stake  people with knowledge of the pact say a last-minute compromise is likely 	3	2	1
But like a hard-fought European bailout to help EADS pay for massive losses on the A400M military plane two years ago  it may not look elegant 	4	2	3
"As one veteran of past battles in the sector said: ""The problem is that everything has been built on a foundation of mistrust between nations that have a problem accepting purely industrial projects and where everyone is seeking guarantees """	4	1	2
Analysis: Dow transports raise warning flag for U S  economy	1	1	2
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A slew of profit warnings from transportation companies like FedEx Corp and Norfolk Southern Corp is raising questions about whether the overall market will end this year on a high note 	2	1	2
"An enduring part of market lore is the notion that gains in the well-known Dow Jones industrial average < DJI> do not hold unless similar moves in the Dow Jones transportation average < DJT> ""confirm"" them "	2	1	1
Strategists tend to look askance when they see steady rises in the 30-stock industrial index when the transportation average is not doing well 	2	1	2
"The idea behind this part of ""Dow theory"" is that manufacturers as well as the railroads  shippers and trucking companies that move their goods are barometers of the U S  economy's performance "	1	1	1
That makes the recent moves in these averages somewhat ominous 	2	1	2
Over the last six months  the Dow industrials have gained 2 9 percent  while the transports have fallen by 5 6 percent 	1	2	2
This is not the first time that industrials have rocketed upward while the transports were suggesting caution 	2	2	2
Transportation stocks hit a peak in mid-1999 but later started to slip  while the Dow continued to rally through early 2000 before stumbling 	2	2	2
In recent months  most railroads and truckers have reported lower shipping volumes as consumers and businesses have worried about the weakening global economy and possible changes in U S  tax regulations 	2	1	2
Until now  stimulus from the U S  Federal Reserve and European Central Bank are helping to keep transport stocks from steeper losses  said Paul Mendelsohn  chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte  Vermont 	2	2	2
If the Dow transports  which closed Monday at 4 960 8  fall below a critical level of 4 860 to 4 900  those shares might plunge and pull other stock indices down in sympathy  Mendelsohn said 	3	1	3
It might not take much to break those technical levels  which have held for about six months  he warned 	2	1	2
Then hedge fund and money managers are going to pay more attention  and you'll probably see the impact across the broader markets 	2	1	1
To be sure  not all analysts subscribe to the Dow theory that transportation stocks are a leading indicator of the broader markets  now that manufacturing is a smaller part of the overall economy 	2	1	1
The Dow theory did a lot better in the 1960s and 1970s  when manufacturing ruled the economy  said James Paulsen  chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis 	2	2	1
"The Dow transportation average ""is not as great a signal in the last couple of decades  when you now have a much more broadly based  diversified economy """	1	1	1
GLOOMY FORECASTS	2	1	3
U S  transportation companies are suffering from a host of problems  including China's slowdown  a slump in demand for coal shipped by railroad  Europe's fiscal crisis and high fuel costs 	2	1	3
See related graphic: http://link reuters com/xed82t	2	1	1
Another factor weighing on transports: Shipping customers are cutting back on spending because of uncertainty about U S  tax policies 	1	1	2
"The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said a ""significant recession"" could result from these massive government spending cuts and tax increases "	2	1	2
At the same time  Republican nominee Mitt Romney is trying to defeat President Barack Obama  a Democrat  in the November 6 election 	1	1	2
For industrials and transports in general  the election and the fiscal cliff are two looming issues that the market is waiting on  said analyst Logan Purk of Edward Jones in St  Louis 	2	1	1
Transportation and logistics companies are also worried 	2	1	2
At least seven of them - FedEx  Norfolk Southern  UTi Worldwide   Swift Transportation Co   Arkansas Best Corp   XPO Logistics Inc and Werner Enterprises Inc have scaled back their profit forecasts in recent weeks 	2	1	2
United Parcel Service Inc led the pack when it cut its outlook in July 	2	1	2
Kansas City Southern bucked the trend 	2	1	2
Its volume grew almost 8 percent in the quarter as the company relies less on coal than its larger railroad peers and is heavily invested in faster-growing Mexico 	2	2	1
LOW HOLIDAY HOPES	1	1	2
Both companies could see a fourth-quarter bounce if consumer demand heats up for new technology products that are typically shipped by premium air freight 	2	2	1
Although Apple Inc's iPhone 5 is a huge hit  some other technology companies have not yet released their new products 	2	2	1
Trucking company Werner Enterprises said in its profit warning that more than half of its 11 top retail customers had lower inventory than a year ago 	1	1	2
It's not necessarily just because they see lower demand  said Art Hatfield managing director in equity research at Raymond James in Memphis 	2	1	2
It's because they see concern about fiscal policy and dysfunction out of Washington and what they may mean for demand three or four months down the road 	2	1	2

Analysis: Romney would send consumers healthcare bill  with benefits	2	2	2
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has a prescription for controlling soaring costs within the $2 8 trillion U S  healthcare system  partly by making consumers pay more of their own medical bills 	2	2	2
Romney's vow to repeal and replace President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul has played prominently in the campaign  even as Romney has offered few details about his alternative 	2	2	1
The former Massachusetts governor's advisers say he would accelerate the use of high-deductible insurance plans that offer lower premiums but require beneficiaries to pay thousands of dollars more in out-of-pocket expenses than they would face under conventional coverage 	2	2	2
Romney's overriding aim is to create a much bigger retail market in healthcare  with transparency on pricing and services  more flexible insurance pools and interstate insurance markets 	2	3	1
That would allow consumers to choose up front what products and services to buy and from whom  according to the Romney campaign 	3	3	1
"The result  Romney wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine  ""will be patients who can confidently choose the coverage that is right for them  who know and care what healthcare costs """	3	3	1
The Romney campaign says its series of changes differ dramatically from Obama's 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  which requires most Americans to buy health coverage and seeks to make it easier to do that by creating state-based insurance exchanges 	3	2	1
Medicaid  the national program for the poor  would be expanded to accommodate those with low incomes 	1	2	1
Romney's approach is a political departure for him 	2	2	1
"In Massachusetts  he oversaw the passage of comprehensive state healthcare changes that later became the model for ""Obamacare "" the president's federal program "	1	1	1
Romney's role in creating the Massachusetts plan made many conservatives wary of him  and in seeking the Republican nomination for president Romney made a point of rejecting Obama's plan as an illegal overreach by the federal government 	3	1	2
Since winning the Republican nomination  however  Romney has said he would support some Obamacare provisions 	3	2	1
More recently  Romney has been criticized for describing emergency rooms as a way to cover the uninsured - the type of expensive treatment that programs such as Obamacare and his Massachusetts plan seek to avoid 	3	2	2
HOW MUCH IS IT?	1	1	1
Romney's new incentive-based strategy also could hold pitfalls for consumers 	2	1	3
Analysts say the use of heath savings accounts favors the affluent  while statistics indicate that high-deductible plans can mean big out-of-pocket costs for people with lower wages and little disposable income 	3	1	3
It remains a very significant tax shelter  and with all tax shelters  it means a lot to people in high (income) brackets  said Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution 	3	1	3
But Romney advisers say the approach strikes at two major contributors to spiraling medical prices: a federal tax exclusion on employer-sponsored health plans and conventional benefit packages that insulate consumers from the true cost of healthcare through co-payments and limited deductibles 	3	2	1
The idea would be to provide new tax breaks for consumers who now have employer-sponsored plans  which are exempt from federal income tax 	2	3	1
But it's unclear whether those breaks would equal the value of the current tax benefits 	2	2	2
Conservative analysts say plans with high deductibles make consumers more responsible because they eliminate co-payments and require the patient to see more of the bill 	3	3	1
Healthcare is the only service in the United States that you buy and use without knowing what the price is  said Dr  Scott Atlas  a Romney adviser with Stanford University's Hoover Institution 	3	1	2
But Obama supporters and some independent analysts say the Romney strategy could backfire  leaving consumers with higher costs and tax assistance that favors the more affluent 	3	2	3
What he's really talking about is shifting more and more of the cost onto the individual  said Christen Linke Young  Obama campaign associate policy director 	3	1	3
"That's what he means when he says 'patient centered '	3	1	3
44 analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019 It's really troubling "	3	1	3
Critics also say the patient-centered approach would do little to help the chronically ill  whose needs account for the lion's share of annual medical costs but who often are unable to change providers or forego expenses 	3	1	3
The Romney campaign said people with high medical expenses would still be able to rely on more conventional plans with co-payments and limited deductibles  adding that high-deductible plans can provide catastrophic coverage 	3	3	2
Growing numbers of U S  employers have embraced high-deductible plans in recent years to try to guard against rising costs that outpace growth in the economy  inflation and wages 	2	2	1
About 19 percent of Americans with employer-sponsored health coverage now are enrolled in high-deductible plans  up from 4 percent in 2006  according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation  which studies healthcare trends 	2	1	1
Deductibles average about $2 200 for individuals and $4 000 for families  while premium savings for beneficiaries average $350 for an individual and $1 000 for a family  according to Kaiser 	2	2	2
Options include higher contribution limits and a wider range of covered costs 	1	2	1
The Romney camp believes those kinds of changes could shift the $800 billion private health insurance market toward high-deductible plans that health savings accounts support 	3	2	1
Employer contributions to health savings accounts now average $600 for individuals and $1 000 for families  according to Kaiser 	2	2	1
A Romney administration also would usher in new tax benefits to help consumers meet their medical bills  possibly including deductions for health expenses and tax credits for those who would not benefit from deductions because they pay little or no income taxes 	3	3	1
Those new tax breaks could replace some or all of the current tax code exclusion that exempts employer-sponsored healthcare benefits from federal income taxes 	3	2	1
The tax exclusion costs the U S  Treasury about $100 billion to $200 billion a year in lost revenue 	2	1	2
"The current tax treatment of health insurance is the engine that fuels our health inflation costs	3	1	2
44 analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019 There are myriad ways of solving that	3	2	1
44 analysis-romney-send-consumers-healthcare-bill-benefits-110405019 But until we solve it  we do not have health reform  the Romney campaign official said "	3	2	2
Animals suspected in spread of new virus	2	1	2
LONDON (AP) — Britain's Health Protection Agency says an early genetic sequence of the new respiratory virus related to SARS shows it is most closely related to bat viruses 	1	1	1
Global health officials say they haven't found evidence the virus can spread between people and suspect the two victims from the Middle East may have caught it from animals 	2	1	2
So far  there are no signs the virus will be as deadly as SARS  or severe acute respiratory syndrome  which killed hundreds of people  mostly in Asia  in a 2003 global outbreak	2	1	3
Experts say camels  sheep or goats — animals commonly found in the region — may be implicated too 	1	1	1
Another 400 West Nile cases reported in U S  in past week: CDC	1	1	3
(Reuters) - More than 400 new U S  cases of West Nile virus emerged in the last week  in an outbreak that remains one of the worst of record but has begun to show signs of slowing down 	1	2	4

Previous research has examined the impact of extreme events on emperor penguins 	1	1	1
At one of the penguin breeding sites  collisions between the icebergs and the ice on which the penguins were nesting killed some and forced others to move to less-ideal breeding sites 	1	1	3
At another site  an iceberg blocked the penguins' route to the open water where they feed  a research team led by Gerald Kooyman of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography reported in 2007 	2	1	2

Weddell seals vs  ice chunks	1	1	2
In the latest study  another team looked at how the icebergs affected the seals living in Erebus Bay on the Ross Sea 	1	1	1
Chambert and colleagues focused on female seals  since they are more reliably spotted on the ice than males 	1	1	1
They found that in four of the five years in which the icebergs were present  the number of females that showed up at the colony was lower than usual 	1	1	2
In years without icebergs  there is a nearly 70-percent chance a female will give birth to a pup 	1	1	1
During the iceberg years  this dropped by about 20 percentage points  down to a 50-percent chance 	1	1	2
How seals respond	1	1	1
Researchers don't know why the icebergs had the effect on the seals that they did  but they have some hypotheses 	2	1	1
The icebergs may have made the seals' breeding sites more difficult to access by altering the terrain of the sea ice 	2	1	2
Other work has shown that the icebergs had a negative effect on the amount of tiny  floating plants  called phytoplankton  in the sea 	1	1	2
This effect could have rippled up the food chain to the seals  which feed on various fish species and other Antarctic foods 	1	1	2
The seals had a few advantages over the penguins 	1	2	1
Unlike the emperor penguins  which must traverse the ice to feed  the female seals generally stay put once they haul out at the breeding site 	2	1	1
The seals may also have benefitted from being farther from B-15 when it broke off the ice shelf  Chambert said 	2	2	1
Chambert and colleagues believe that the drop in reproduction is indicative of seals' strategy for dealing with difficult times 	3	2	2
Seals can live up to 30 years  and they breed annually beginning at age 6  meaning if they miss a year or two  they will have a chance again later 	1	2	1
"This is a long-lived species	1	1	1
47 antarctic-seals-survive-arrival-massive-icebergs-231437422 Because of that  you expect a strategy that will favor survival over reproduction  he said "	2	2	1
By putting off reproduction  the seals can spend more energy on survival 	1	2	2
This gives them the chance to breed again when conditions are better 	1	2	1
More frequent iceberg calving  such as those predicted as a result of global warming  could have had a more negative effect on the seal population  the researchers write 	3	1	3
The research was published today (Sept 	1	1	1

Anti-Muslim film got LA County permit for shoot	1	1	2
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The makers of an anti-Muslim film that sparked violent protests had a one-day permit to shoot parts of the movie at a Los Angeles County ranch and were allowed to use animals and fire 	2	1	2
"In the document released Thursday by FilmLA  the group that handles permits for the county  the movie later known as ""Innocence of Muslims"" is listed as ""Desert Warriors"" and its production company as Media for Christ "	2	1	2
A $1 195 permit allowed a shoot at Blue Cloud Ranch with 20 actors and 20 crew 	1	1	1
"Also allowed were the use of animals within regulations and burning torches and barrels to ""simulate a building on fire """	1	1	3
Names of the producer  director and others were redacted before the permit was released 	1	1	1

Antigua wants US to lift Internet gambling hurdle	2	1	1
"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Antigua and Barbuda is threatening unspecified sanctions against the U S  if the federal government fails to lift a trade ""blockade"" preventing the island from hosting Internet gambling  a top government official from the island nation said Wednesday "	1	1	2
Antigua Finance Minister Harold Lovell said that since 2004  the U S  has fought  lost and now disregards World Trade Organization rulings that the federal government improperly bans banks and credit card companies from processing online gambling payments to businesses outside the U S 	2	1	2
He did not provide specifics 	1	1	1
An aide to U S  Trade Representative Ron Kirk did not immediately respond to messages about Lovell's speech 	1	1	1
Lovell pointed to recent statements by Kirk about WTO challenges filed by the U S  against China over policies the American government says improperly subsidize exports of auto parts in violation of WTO free trade rules 	1	1	2
"Antigua and Barbuda hopes ""this unequivocal stance signals an end to the U S  government's decade-long violation of WTO rulings"" in online gambling  the Caribbean nation finance minister said "	3	1	2
Lovell spoke to the U S  Online Gaming Law 2012 conference at the Bellagio resort on the Las Vegas Strip 	1	1	1
He cited a May 2007 announcement by the U S  trade representative that the U S  had lost the WTO Antigua case  but said that after four years  the process still had not been concluded 	1	1	2
Meanwhile  Antigua is has been able since 2008 to offer Internet gambling to U K  countries under regulatory oversight  Lovell said 	1	1	1
Lovell cited a U S  Department of Justice memorandum last December that concluded that the Wire Act  upon which the U S  law banning Antiguan online gambling business is based  applies only to interstate gambling on sporting contests 	1	1	1
The implications of this narrow decision are enormous  Lovell said 	2	1	1

AP source: Colts' Pagano diagnosed with illness	1	1	2
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indianapolis Colts coach Chuck Pagano has been diagnosed with an undisclosed illness and could miss Sunday's game against Green Bay 	1	1	2
A person with knowledge of the situation confirmed the illness Monday 	1	1	2
The person spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press because the team had not released details yet 	1	1	1
The Colts have scheduled a morning news conference with owner Jim Irsay  general manage Ryan Grigson and a doctor 	1	1	1
The 51-year-old Pagano is in his first season as a head coach 	1	1	1
He was hired in January after serving as the Baltimore Ravens' defensive coordinator 	1	1	1
Pagano earned his first win Sept  16 against the Vikings 	1	3	1
The Colts (1-2) had a bye last weekend 	1	1	1
The illness was first reported by The Indianapolis Star 	1	1	2
Man behind anti-Islam film arrested	1	1	2
Nakoula Basseley Nakoula  55  has been on probation for a 2010 federal check fraud conviction that brought a 21-month prison sentence 	1	1	2
Under terms of his probation  he was not to use computers or the Internet for five years without approval from his probation officer 	1	1	1
Nakoula was taken into custody Thursday  said U S  Attorney's spokesman Thomas Mrozek 	1	1	1
It was closed to media and the public 	1	1	1
"Protests have erupted around the Middle East over a 14-minute trailer for the film ""Innocence of Muslims"" that depicts Prophet Muhammad as a womanizer  religious fraud and child molester "	1	1	3
Nakoula  a Christian originally from Egypt  went into hiding after he was identified as the man behind the trailer 	1	1	1
The full story about Nakoula and the film still isn't known 	1	1	1
The movie was made last year by a man who called himself Sam Bacile 	1	1	1
After the violence erupted  a man who identified himself as Bacile called media outlets including The Associated Press  took credit for the film and said it was meant to portray the truth about Muhammad and Islam  which he called a cancer 	2	1	2
The next day  the AP determined there was no Bacile and linked the identity to Nakoula  a former gas station owner with a drug conviction and a history of using aliases 	1	1	2
Federal authorities later confirmed there was no Bacile and that Nakoula was behind the movie 	1	1	1
Before going into hiding  Nakoula acknowledged to the AP he was involved with the film  but said he only worked on logistics and management 	2	1	1
A film permit listed Media for Christ  a Los Angeles-area charity run by other Egyptian Christians  as the production company 	1	1	1
Steve Klein  an insurance agent in Hemet and outspoken Muslim critic  has said he was a consultant and promoter for the film 	1	1	1
The trailer still can be found on YouTube 	1	1	1
The Obama administration asked Google  YouTube's parent  to take down the video but the company has refused  saying it did not violate its content standards 	1	1	1
"They say they were hired for a film titled ""Desert Warrior"" and there was no mention of Islam or Muhammad in the script "	2	1	1
Those references were dubbed in after filming was completed 	1	1	1
AUCKLAND  New Zealand (AP) — Nearly two years after President Barack Obama ordered 33 000 more U S  troops to Afghanistan to tamp down the escalating Taliban violence  the last of those surge troops have left the country  U S  officials said Thursday 	2	2	3
And it's called into question the core strategy that relies on NATO troops working shoulder to shoulder with Afghans  training them to take over the security of their own country so the U S  and its allies can leave at the end of 2014 as planned 	2	1	3
The key goal was to ensure that the Taliban did not regain a foothold in the country that could allow it once again to become a safe haven for terror groups 	2	2	3
And there was hope that Taliban members would be willing to come to the peace table 	3	2	2
Military commanders say the war strategy is on track and that they have made broad gains against the Taliban  wresting control of areas where the insurgents once had strong footholds 	3	3	3
And U S  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has characterized the insider attacks as the last gasp of a desperate insurgency 	3	3	2
But other top military leaders  including U S  Gen  Martin Dempsey  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  are worried about the impact of the attacks on the troops 	2	1	3
"Dempsey called them a ""very serious threat"" to the war campaign and has declared that ""something has to change """	4	1	4
Aporkalypse Not Now: Bacon Shortage Exaggerated  Experts Say	2	1	1
Can you imagine a world where there is no other white meat?	2	1	1
"If skyrocketing use of the term ""aporkalypse"" on Twitter is any indication  a recent statement from the United Kingdom's National Pig Association is causing some anxious consumers to do just that "	3	1	2
"But is the trade group's claim that ""a world shortage of pork and bacon next year is now unavoidable"" really true?"	2	1	2
If you define a shortage as a situation where product cannot be found or where buyers must wait in lines to buy a product  the answer is no  Cindy Cunningham  a spokeswoman for the Des Moines  Iowa-based National Pork Board  told Life's Little Mysteries by email 	2	1	1
But the quantity of pork available to consumers in the U S  and the rest of the world will decline in 2013  due to high feed costs and significant financial losses by producers 	2	1	2
The high feed prices are attributed partly to this year's widespread droughts  which have jacked up corn and soy prices and resulted in half of all U S  counties being declared disaster areas 	2	1	2
Some farmers have tried to cope by feeding candy to livestock 	1	1	1
"I'd be surprised worldwide if it's more than a 2 or 3 percent decrease on per-capita availability	3	1	1
54 aporkalypse-not-now-bacon-shortage-exaggerated-experts-160739385 That number hasn't changed that much in a long time "	3	1	1
Meyer notes that global availability of pork has for the most part been on a forward march in recent years 	2	2	1
Consumption reached an all-time peak in 2010  at 33 4 pounds (15 1 kilograms) per person  before it decreased to 32 8 pounds (14 8 kg) per person in 2011  according to data from the U S  Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service 	1	1	1
That figure is likely to bounce back slightly this year  to 32 94 pounds (14 9 kg)  before the economic effects of the drought are fully felt by consumers  according to the USDA 	3	1	1
If we have good weather next year  I think costs will come down and they [pork producers] will be back in a profitable place at least by 2014  he said 	2	2	1
Still  the long-term prospects for current global pork consumption habits may not be good 	2	1	2

Apple App Store now prominently suggesting Maps app alternatives	1	1	1
Hot off news of Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook’s public apology for iOS 6′s awful new Maps app  the Cupertino-based company is now going the extra mile to help upset iOS 6 users find mapping alternatives 	2	1	2
As discovered by Digital Trends’ Molly McHugh  the App Store home page now has a big icon that says “Find maps for your iPhone ”	2	1	1
Users who click on it will find a list of map apps that Apple recommends 	1	1	1
Currently at the top of the charts is MotionX GPS Drive  Waze and MapQuest 	1	1	1
Cook’s apology and the new maps app section are clear admissions that the integrated iOS Maps app will take some time to fix  it could even be years before Maps begins to approach the quality of more established offerings 	2	1	2
Remember  Google’s (GOOG) Maps app didn’t become an all-star overnight — it took seven years for Google Maps to get to what it is today 	3	1	1
And Google now has a team of 7 100 employees working in that division alone 	1	1	1
Until Google releases a proper standalone Google Maps app for iOS (if it releases one)  users who are running iOS 6 will just have to look elsewhere for their mapping needs 	2	1	1
This is what users will see after they click on the “Find maps for your iPhone/iPad” button on the App Store:	1	1	1
Apple CEO apologizes for Maps flaws  recommends rivals	1	1	2
The rare apology follows Apple's launch of its own mapping service earlier this month  when it began selling the iPhone 5 and rolled out iOS 6  the highly anticipated update to its mobile software platform 	2	1	1
Users complained that the new Maps service - based on Dutch navigation equipment and digital map maker TomTom NV's data - contained geographical errors and gaps in information  and that it lacked features that made Google Maps so popular from public transit directions to traffic data and street-view pictures 	2	1	2
Unusually  he suggested that customers download rival mapping services available in Apple's App Store while the company improves the product 	3	1	1
While we're improving Maps  you can try alternatives by downloading map apps from the App Store like Bing  MapQuest and Waze  or use Google or Nokia maps by going to their websites and creating an icon on your home screen to their web app  he said in the letter 	2	1	1
Apple is typically loathe to tout rival services and the contrite apology by Cook is an indication of how Apple is changing under the chief executive who took over last year from co-founder Steve Jobs just before his death 	3	1	2
It also took the additional step of prominently displaying the rival services on its Apps Store 	2	1	1
It is a bit unusual but at the same time  Tim is keeping Apple's commitment to provide the best user experience for customers  Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said 	3	2	1
Apple's home-grown Maps feature -- stitched together by acquiring mapping companies and data from many providers including Waze  Intermap  DigitalGlobe and Urban Mapping -- was introduced with much fanfare in June by software chief Scott Forstall 	3	1	1
But errors and omissions in the maps service quickly emerged after the software was rolled out  ranging from misplaced buildings and mislabelled cities to duplicated geographical features 	2	1	2
The last time Apple faced such widespread criticism was in 2010  when users complained of signal reception issues on the then-new iPhone 4 model 	1	1	2
A defiant Jobs at the time rejected any suggestion the iPhone 4's design was flawed  but offered consumers free phone cases at a rare  90-minute press conference called to address those complaints 	2	1	2
He also said the issue was shared by all the major manufacturers  naming rivals Research in Motion  Samsung Electronics and HTC Corp 	2	1	2
Cook himself played a key role in convincing Jobs to tackle the negative publicity that arose around that issue  something he was initially reluctant to do  according to his biographer 	2	1	1
Finally Tim Cook was able to shake him out of his lethargy  Walter Isaacson said in his biography on the late Silicon Valley icon 	3	2	2
It remains to be seen how fast Apple can fix the mapping glitches 	3	1	1
Jobs had been in a similar position when he allowed email synchronization software MobileMe to launch in 2008  to deadly reviews 	2	1	1
The service is now folded into the iCloud product 	1	1	1
Mapping is a complex process that takes a lot of resources and years to perfect  said Marcus Thielking  co-founder of Skobbler  maker of the popular GPS Navigation 2 app  built using the crowdsourced OpenStreetMap platform 	2	1	1
It helps a lot if you have great data to start with  he said  adding that it appears that different database were thrown together in building Apple Maps 	2	2	1
They (Apple) can offer incremental updates and that's what they will do 	2	1	1
Cook said that more than 100 million iOS devices are using the new Apple Maps and that the more people use Maps  the better it will get 	2	2	1
He also offered some hints on why the company decided to remove Google Maps 	2	1	1
"Apple launched the Google-powered Maps ""initially with the first version of iOS"" and created a home-grown version of the service as it wanted to provide more features  Cook said "	2	1	1
As time progressed  we wanted to provide our customers with even better Maps including features such as turn-by-turn directions  voice integration  Flyover and vector-based maps  he said in the letter 	2	1	1
Google provides turn-by-turn navigation on Android-based devices but the popular feature was not available for Apple devices 	1	1	1
Apple Maps replaced Google Maps in iOS 6 and the Google service is now only available through a browser 	1	1	1
Apple’s downfall seen on the horizon	2	1	3
Have reports of Apple’s (AAPL) death been greatly exaggerated? Predicting the inevitable demise of the most successful consumer electronics company in the world is something of a pastime for many news outlets  Every leader eventually falls  of course  but predicting how and when is a sure way to attract attention  And so in Wednesday’s edition of The Wall Street Journal  an opinion piece proudly proclaimed that “TV will be Apple’s undoing ”	3	1	3
“Apple’s fans imagine the company can do for TV what it did for music: breaking up the existing distribution model  Forget about it ” Jenkins writes  “Television is about to demonstrate the inadequacy of Apple’s own business model ”	4	2	3
For Apple to succeed in this space  it will apparently “have to focus more on giving its devices superb access to content it doesn’t control and hasn’t approved ” and Jenkins doesn’t think Apple’s top brass is up to the task 	2	1	2
“The real test will be for senior management ” he writes  “The time to worry will be if Apple’s quixotic quest for TV leads it to block more realistic solutions that emerge on the open Internet  When Apple admits defeat about TV  that may be the best sign for the company’s future ”	2	2	2
Jenkins had previously foreseen the “Microsofting” of Apple when it launched the “junky” iPad 10 years ago  As Fortune notes  Apple has sold more than 100 million iPads since that point in time 	1	1	2
Apple Maps App Gets Lost on Twitter: Only 10% of Tweets Approve	2	1	2

SEE ALSO: Apple's Maps App: Just How Bad is it?	1	1	1
If there's a silver lining for Apple  it's that only 22% of the tweets expressed an outright hatred of the app 	3	2	4
"But another 30% cracked jokes at the expense of Maps  such as this from entrepreneur Chris Eh Young: ""If you ordered an iPhone 5  shipments are being delayed "	3	3	2
The remaining 30% of tweets were neutral  merely passing on news stories or updates about Maps 	1	1	1
The full stats:	1	1	1
Crimson Hexagon also examined Twitter sentiment about the iPhone 5 itself  and found a slight weakening of interest in the wake of the record-breaking smartphone launch 	2	3	1
Positive tweets about the phone fell from 38% at launch to 30% now  while negative tweets rose from 11% to 20% 	2	2	2
Some 12% of all negative tweets about the iPhone 5 mentioned Maps 	2	1	2
Is the anti-Maps chatter likely to increase or to die down?	1	1	1

Apple's Cook sorry for Maps errors  suggests rivals	1	1	2
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook apologized Friday to customers frustrated with glaring errors in its new Maps service  and  in an unusual move for the consumer giant  directed them to rival services instead  such as Google Inc's Maps 	2	1	2
The rare apology follows Apple's launch of its own mapping service earlier this month  when it began selling the iPhone 5 and rolled out iOS 6  the highly anticipated update to its mobile software platform 	2	1	1
Users complained that the new Maps service - based on Dutch navigation equipment and digital map maker TomTom NV's's data - contained geographical errors and gaps in information  and that it lacked features that made Google Maps so popular  including public transit directions  comprehensive traffic data or street view pictures 	1	1	2
"We are extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make Maps better  Cook said in a letter to customers released on its website  adding that the company ""fell short"" of its commitment to deliver ""the best experience possible to our customers """	2	1	2
He then suggested that customers download rival mapping services available in Apple's App store  while the company improves the product 	1	1	1
Apple is typically loathe to tout rival services and the contrite apology by Cook is an indication of how Apple is changing under the chief executive who took over last year from co-founder Steve Jobs just before his death 	3	1	2
A defiant Jobs at the time rejected any suggestion the iPhone 4's design was flawed but offered consumers free phone cases at a rare  90-minute press conference called to address those complaints 	2	2	2
But ties between the two companies have been strained by the rise of Google's Android mobile operating system  now the world's leading platform for smartphones 	2	1	2
You know Apple has high expectations when selling more than five million iPhone 5s in three days still isn't enough to impress investors 	2	2	2
Apple's stock opened at $686 91 on Monday  down nearly 2% from the previous close of $700 09 	1	2	2
In the days leading up to the launch  several analysts predicted that Apple would sell roughly twice as many iPhone 5s in the opening weekend as it did with the iPhone 4S last year 	3	3	1
Jeffries analyst Peter Misek predicted 8 million iPhone 5s would be sold  while top Apple analyst Gene Munster put the number between 6-10 million 	3	3	1
After seeing the long lines on launch day  Munster settled on 8 million as the number 	3	2	1
These and other analysts typically pointed out a couple key factors influencing their predictions: buzz for the iPhone 5 had really been building up for about two years  and the fact that Apple rolled out the new iPhone in two more countries than the iPhone 4S 	3	2	1
More recently  Apple revealed that it received twice as many pre-orders for the iPhone 5 as it did for the iPhone 4S  further fueling speculation of blockbuster iPhone 5 sales 	2	3	1
As it turned out  Apple still ended up having a record-setting launch  but opening weekend sales of the iPhone 5 were only about one million units higher than the opening weekend sales for the iPhone 4S last year 	2	2	2
What's more  as Asymco analyst Horace Dediu points out  the iPhone 5 sold at roughly the same rate as the iPhone 4s when you normalize for the number of countries in which the phones were available over opening weekend 	2	2	2
The company's CEO Tim Cook said Apple sold out of its initial inventory  though it continues to ship iPhone 5s to stores and take orders online 	2	2	2
As of publication  Apple's stock had rebounded somewhat and was trading above $690 a share 	1	1	1
When Will Arctic Ice Completely Disappear?	2	1	3
The Arctic sea ice just hit its lowest extent since measurements began in the 1970s  raising the question of when Arctic summer sea ice will disappear for good 	2	1	3
"Sea-ice decline is a good example of one of those areas where the projections are too conservative  i e	1	2	2
61 arctic-ice-completely-disappear-220412745 where the observed decline is decades ahead of schedule relative to the model projections  Michael Mann  a Pennsylvania State University climate scientist  told LiveScience in an email "	1	1	2
Sea ice reached its lowest recorded extent on Sunday  Sept  16  covering only 1 32 million square miles (3 41 million square kilometers) of ocean and blowing past the previous 2007 record of 1 61 square miles (4 17 million square kilometers)  according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) 	1	1	2
Unlike icebergs  which break off from glaciers  sea ice forms when ocean water freezes 	1	1	1
The loss of the ice will likely exacerbate global warming  as ice cover reflects sunlight away from the Earth  while open ocean absorbs the sun's heat 	2	1	2
[10 Crucial Facts About Arctic Sea Ice]	1	1	1
Sea ice varies quite a bit each year  said Walt Meier  a research scientist at the NSIDC 	2	1	1
Thus  researchers expect to see an overall downward trend in ice cover  but it could bounce back somewhat next year 	2	1	2
We wouldn't expect it to keep going down straight off the map  so to speak  Meier said during a press conference Thursday (Sept 	2	1	2
20) 	1	1	1
We expect there to be more ups and downs 	2	2	2
"The most extreme estimates of when Arctic summer ice could vanish peg the time in four or five years  but Meier said those predictions are ""very unlikely """	3	1	2
Much of the northernmost ice in the Arctic is old and thick  he said  and might be more resistant to melt 	2	2	2
If so  summer ice extent could hit a plateau and not disappear for many years 	2	2	1
A lot of people talk potentially in the next 20 to 30 years we may become ice-free  Meier said 	2	1	2
That's certainly quite plausible 	3	1	1
The loss of ice so far has been dramatic 	2	1	2
In 1980  Arctic sea ice covered approximately the same area as the lower 48 U S  states  minus Oregon and Washington 	2	1	1
In 2012  it would barely cover half the country  with everything east of the Mississippi melted off as well as Oregon  Washington  Kansas  Nebraska and North and South Dakota 	2	1	1

Arctic ice shrinks to all-time low  half 1980 size	2	1	3
WASHINGTON (AP) — Scientists say the amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean shrank to an all-time low this year  smashing old records for the critical climate indicator 	2	1	3
The ice cap at the North Pole measured 1 32 million square miles on Sunday 	1	1	1
The previous low was 1 61 million square miles in 2007 	1	1	2
Records go back to 1979 based on satellite tracking 	1	1	1
Ice in the Arctic melts in summer and grows in winter  and it started growing again on Monday 	1	2	1
Meier says in the 1980s  summer ice would cover an area slightly smaller than the Lower 48 states 	1	1	1
Now it is about half that size 	1	1	2

Assange to U N : Bradley Manning Has Been Tortured	2	1	3
Julian Assange claimed in a live video address broadcast during an event parallel to the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday that Bradley Manning  the U S  Army soldier accused of providing classified intelligence to WikiLeaks  has been tortured while imprisoned 	2	1	3
Bradley Manning  science fair all-star  soldier and patriot was degraded  abused and psychologically tortured by his own government  said Assange  broadcasting from the Ecuardoian Embassy in London where he's been living for months 	2	1	3
"Assange was careful not to confirm that Manning was involved in any intelligence leak -- the words ""alleged"" or ""allegedly"" appear five times throughout the approximately 1 700-word speech "	2	1	2
"He also accused the U S  of excessively prosecuting whistleblowers  while calling on the American government to ""cease its persecution of WikiLeaks  to cease its persecution of our people and to cease its persecution of our alleged sources """	2	1	2
The US administration is trying to erect a national regime of secrecy  a national regime of obfuscation  said Assange 	2	1	2
A regime where any government employee revealing sensitive information to a media organization can be sentenced to death  life imprisonment or for espionage and journalists from a media organization with them 	2	1	3
Ecuador granted political asylum to Assange earlier this year 	1	1	1
However  British police surround the Ecuadorian Embassy in London  having warned Assange he'll be arrested and extradited to Sweden to be questioned on allegations of sexual assault if he leaves the embassy 	2	1	2
Assange fears extradition to Sweden would mean being sent to the U S   which he claims has secret charges against him relating to WikiLeaks' release of classified American military and diplomatic cables 	2	1	2
"The U S  has denied those claims  but a report from the Sydney Morning Herald claims that the United States has classified Assange and WikiLeaks as ""enemies of the state """	1	1	2
"Ecuador's government said Thursday it was prepared to shelter Assange for ""years"" while it negotiates with Britain and Sweden "	2	1	1
"Manning  meanwhile  is being held in military prison on 22 charges  including that of ""aiding the enemy """	1	1	2
His trial is scheduled for February 2013 	1	1	1
(Reuters) - Astex Pharmaceuticals Inc said it would discontinue the development of its experimental small-cell lung cancer drug amuvatinib as the drug failed to meet the main goal of a mid-stage study 	2	1	2

However  Amuvatinib showed only a 9 5 percent response rate 	1	1	2
The company said it would now consider licensing the compound to any partners interested in its development 	2	2	1
Attacking Iran: Is Israel bluffing?	2	1	2
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said this week that Israel's talk of launching a surgical military strike to end Tehran's nuclear program is pure bluff 	3	1	2
While we are fully ready to defend ourselves  we do not take these threats seriously  Ahmadinejad said after arriving in New York for a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly 	3	1	2
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called on President Obama to draw a ""red line"" that Iran can't cross if it wants to avoid a military confrontation  and at the U N  on Tuesday  Obama warned Tehran that his administration would ""do what we must"" to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons "	2	1	2
Netanyahu worries that Iran could be close to building its first nuclear bomb in six or seven months  although the U S  believes the danger is farther off 	2	1	2
Israel may very well attack Iran: Israel isn't just rattling sabers  David Makovsky  an Israel expert and senior fellow at the Washington Institute  tells National Journal 	2	1	2
"Israeli leaders aren't sure ""about American resolve if diplomacy and sanctions fail "" and they're ""hardwired"" to launch a military strike alone if that's what it takes ""The"	2	1	2
"path to war with Iran"""	1	1	2
"Plus  the ""mullahs are not madmen"" who would risk their own nuclear annihilation by attacking Israel  and Netanyahu knows that "	2	2	2
"Obama called Bibi's bluff?"""	1	1	1
"Netanyahu wants U S  help — but he's dead serious: I'm ""skeptical that Israel can go it alone "" says Michael Ross at Canada's National Post  but that doesn't mean Netanyahu is bluffing "	3	1	2
Iran is a sworn enemy of Israel and the West  and the stakes here are too high to be making idle threats 	2	1	3
"Netanyahu is just ""applying much needed pressure"" to make sure the international community does something before it's too late "	2	1	2
"needs our help to subdue Iran"""	2	1	2
Auction of $7 Renoir cancelled  may be stolen from Baltimore museum	2	1	3
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Virginia auction house on Thursday cancelled the sale of a Renoir painting bought at a flea market for $7 after signs the work was stolen from the Baltimore Museum of Art decades ago 	1	1	3
"The painting ""Paysage Bords de Seine"" by Pierre-Auguste Renoir was to have gone under the hammer on Saturday but ownership questions halted the sale  said Lucie Holland  a spokeswoman for Potomack Co  the Alexandria  Virginia  auctioneer "	1	1	2
The rest of the auction will go on  but the Renoir has been withdrawn  she said 	1	1	2
A Virginia woman bought the signed French Impressionist painting at a West Virginia flea market a year or two ago  hoping the frame would be of some use 	2	2	1
She ignored the work until it turned up again while housecleaning and had it appraised by Potomack in July 	2	2	2
The auctioneers verified it as a Renoir and estimated its worth at $75 000 to $100 000 	1	3	1
"The Baltimore Museum of Art told Potomack on Wednesday that its records indicated ""Paysage Bords de Seine "" or ""Landscape on the Banks of the Seine "" was stolen while on loan to the museum in 1951  the auction house said "	1	1	3
Potomack told the FBI and a federal probe is under way 	1	1	2
The Renoir came to the Baltimore museum through one of its leading benefactors  collector Saidie May 	1	3	1
Her family bought the painting from the Bernheim-Jeune gallery in Paris in 1926 	1	1	1
The Washington Post found records in the museum's library on Tuesday that showed May had lent the paintings and other works to the museum in 1937  Potomack said 	1	1	1
After the newspaper told it of the findings  the Baltimore museum checked its files and found a loan record showing the Renoir had been stolen on November 17  1951 	1	1	3
Doreen Bolger  the museum director  said the museum's probe into what happened to the painting was in early stages but was centred on May 	1	1	2
As its ownership was going through legal transfer  the painting was stolen while still listed as on loan 	1	1	3
At this point we just want to make sure that the painting winds up where it belongs and that we provide all the information we can to law enforcement about this issue  Bolger said 	2	2	2
Potomack said the painting had not turned up when it checked London's Art Loss Register  a database of stolen and lost art 	1	1	2
It also consulted the FBI's art theft website to confirm it was not listed as stolen 	1	1	2
Australian PM Gillard cancels speech due to illness	1	1	1
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has taken ill after arriving in New York and cancelled a luncheon speech appearance on Monday  a government spokesman said 	1	1	1
Gillard was scheduled to deliver a speech on the Australian economy to a luncheon co-sponsored by the Asia Society and the Economic Club of New York 	1	1	1
Foreign Minister Bob Carr  also in New York for the annual United Nations General Assembly meeting  was asked to step in and deliver Gillard's prepared remarks 	1	1	1
"Australians suddenly richer as statistician ""finds"" $338 billion"	3	3	2
"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australians are suddenly a whole lot better off after the government statistician ""found"" A$325 billion ($338 billion) in share assets previously unrecognized "	4	3	2
The Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday released its latest report on household assets which included massive upward revisions to estimates for equity holdings 	1	1	1
Total financial assets were now put at A$3 1 trillion at the end of March  compared to the originally reported A$2 77 trillion 	1	1	1
The revision is worth roughly A$14 380 for every one of the country's 22 6 million people 	1	2	1
This issue incorporates new estimates for households holding of unlisted shares and other equity in other private non financial corporations  the statistician drily noted 	2	2	1
The value of such equity is now put at A$383 billion at the end of March  compared to the original A$91 billion 	1	1	1
The Bureau of Statistics has effectively 'found' A$325 billion in household wealth  said Craig James  chief economist at CommSec 	3	2	2
Total financial assets also rose further in the second quarter to stand at A$3 11 trillion by the end of June  up A$76 billion on the same period last year 	1	1	1
No less than A$702 billion of that was held in bank deposits 	1	1	1
Australian banks have been competing fiercely for deposits to reduce their dependence on offshore funding  while households have been keen to save more in the wake of the global financial crisis 	3	2	3
Since the end of 2007 the amount of money stashed in bank deposits has climbed by A$260 billion  or almost 60 percent 	1	1	1
Australians are continuing their love affair with defensive assets such as cash and bank deposits  said James 	4	2	2
And it's not just Aussie consumers  but companies and even superannuation funds  he added 	4	2	2
Non-financial companies held A$395 billion in cash and deposits at the end of June  suggesting one reason why lending to businesses has been so sluggish in the last couple of years 	3	1	3
The ABS now estimates the ratio of debt to liquid assets was 129 1 percent in March  well down on the original estimate of 170 1 percent 	2	2	1
Authorities: California man behind anti-Muslim film arrested on probation violation	1	1	3
U S  Attorney's spokesman Thomas Mrozek said Thursday that 55-year-old Nakoula Basseley Nakoula was taken into custody 	2	1	2
A U S  District Court hearing was scheduled for Nakoula on Thursday afternoon 	1	1	1
It was closed to media and the public 	1	1	2
Nakoula is on probation for a 2010 federal check fraud conviction 	1	1	2
"Protests have erupted around the Middle East over a 14-minute trailer for the film ""Innocence of Muslims"" that depicts Muhammad as a womanizer  religious fraud and child molester "	3	1	4
Autism and a Political Career Collide in Dad's Two Worlds	3	2	2
"Mike Lake describes his autistic son Jaden as a ""3- or 4-year-old trapped in a 16-year-old body "" a boy unable to speak or comprehend emotions "	1	1	3
"For Jaden  abstract thinking is a challenge and his most direct communication is reaching for his father's face and crying out ""bababa"" when he needs to be understood "	1	1	3
"But that ""beautiful simplicity"" is enough for his dad "	3	2	2
I lay down with him on the bed at night and he looks at me in communication mode  said Lake  43 	2	2	1
71 autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health He talks along with me at the same time bababa-ing	2	1	2
71 autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health It's the strangest thing	3	1	2
71 autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health We are not communicating anything concrete  not the world I am living in  but for us it is a connection "	3	2	2
Since 2006  Lake's world has been Canada's House of Commons  where he delves into the complex political issues of the day as a member of Parliament and secretary to the minister of industry 	3	1	1
"I didn't get elected to Parliament on the autism issue  said Lake  42  ""But as time has gone by  it's one world "	2	1	1
It has allowed me a platform to get out there and raise awareness 	2	2	1
I decided early on to include him in every opportunity we could and not to hide the family and to use the opportunities over time to share the story of an amazing kid and what life has been like for us 	3	3	1
This week  he is in New York City speaking before the fifth annual World Focus on Autism  co-hosted by Autism Speaks and Ban Soon-taek  wife of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon 	1	1	1
The world of autism is still a mystery 	3	1	2
And while research has advanced  particularly in the area of genetics  it is still a puzzle to scientists 	1	2	2
Some studies show autism strikes as many as 1 in 88 children  mostly boys 	1	1	3
"When something gets in his mind  he grabs my face in an escalating 'bababa' until he gets the explanation he needs  said Lake  ""He is obsessed with dogs and will go nose to nose with any dog and he likes baking chocolate chip cookies and bowling Saturday mornings with Dad "	3	2	2
71 autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health But for Jaden  who is on the cusp of adulthood  the future presents mind-boggling challenges	3	1	3
71 autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health He has no sense of danger and will cross the street unaware of the traffic 	1	1	4
71 autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health Once  on the grounds of the House of Commons  he lunged for a German Shepherd security dog  grabbing its neck and going mouth-to-mouth"" with the animal "	1	1	3
Though he cannot communicate verbally  Jaden is capable of much that might translate into a future vocation: a 130 score in bowling  a job cataloging books at the library and making chocolate chip cookies 	2	2	2
He is also extraordinarily affectionate  not typical in autistic children 	3	2	1
"In a Canadian television interview with his father  ebullient Jaden is a far cry from Dustin Hoffman's character in the film ""Rain Man "" a robotic autistic adult "	3	2	1
Each year on April 3  which is World Autism Awareness Day  Lake delivers an impassioned speech before the House of Commons -- a very personal one 	2	3	1
"Mr	1	1	1
71 autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health Speaker  he begins "	1	1	1
71 autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health But I can honestly say I couldn't be more proud of my boy	3	3	1
71 autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health He is always quick with a high-five or a kiss  is never ever a bully  and loves everyone without a hint of judgment	3	3	1
71 autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health I think we could all use a little more of that "	2	1	1
"As a politician  Lake encourages ""every family in North America"" to meet their elected officials and educate them on autism "	2	2	2
Bring your loved one with autism  I tell people  he said 	2	2	2
If you can't explain autism because the family member is acting up -- they can explain it better than you ever could 	2	2	2
"He wouldn't respond when calling him and at first we thought he had a hearing problem  said Lake  ""Then we realized when he was two floors away and we turned on [the TV show] 'Barney' he came running down """	2	1	2
"He could put foam blocks with letters of the alphabet in order ""without hesitation "" according to his father "	1	2	1
All those with autism are different 	1	1	1
"You have to be an expert at reading your own child  said Lake  ""Jaden is unique -- he wants to talk but he can't "	2	1	3
"Other kids are completely silent """	1	1	2
But he cannot articulate his feelings 	2	1	2
So far  in a K to 12 school where Jaden has gone his whole life  his classmates have embraced him 	2	2	1
"He has been involved in musical theater  dancing in a production of ""Oliver "" and this year learning to play an old man  who walks across the stage with a cup "	1	2	1
"He wants to make us happy with the answer he gives  said Lake  ""His default answer is yes """	3	2	2
They worry about his future  when they are not around to love and care for him  but hope Jaden can contribute with the skills he does possess 	3	2	3
"We have chosen to focus on what is in front of us  said Lake  not ruling out living or vocational opportunities ""that are good for him """	3	1	1
"Jaden has had intensive interventions -- about 36 hours a week -- since he was 2  He can use the computer to write down ""very basic and concrete"" words  but his parents have decided that it's more important to interact with him in other ways than to rely on a speech-activated device "	2	2	2
Jaden's mother cried when he learned to kiss for the first time at age 11 	3	3	2
Lake  who worked for 11 years for his hometown ice hockey team  the Edmonton Oilers  said his relationship with Jaden surprises him in some ways 	3	1	1
I am a very competitive person  so the idea of having a child with special needs would have terrified me  he said 	3	2	3
"I had visions of my son playing in the NHL and graduating with honors	3	2	1
71 autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health I look back and I can't imagine loving a kid more than I love Jaden	3	4	1 
71 autism-political-career-collide-dads-two-worlds-130402507--abc-news-health And I look back at every milestone and I'm every bit as proud of everything he's done "	3	3	1
"I always say that if we could snap our fingers and Jaden wouldn't have autism  said Lake  ""We'd miss the Jaden we have now """	3	1	2
Now that he's returned to Earth from a five-month stay on the International Space Station  NASA astronaut Joe Acaba is still getting used to life on the ground 	1	2	1
Acaba landed in Kazakhstan Sept  16 after riding a Russian Soyuz spaceship back to Earth with two cosmonauts  Gennady Padalka and Sergei Revin  The three spaceflyers had just finished stints as crewmembers on the Expedition 32 mission of the International Space Station  which orbits Earth 240 miles (386 km) overhead 	1	1	1
"I'm feeling much better  getting used to it  and better and better every day  Acaba told SPACE com during an interview Wednesday (Sept  25)  ""You forget how strong gravity is when you've been gone for a while """	2	3	1
During his tenure in space  Acaba had a hectic schedule of science experiments  space station upkeeping duties  and hosting the occasional robotic cargo-delivery spacecraft  In fact  Acaba was present for the very first visit of a privately-built vehicle  the Dragon capsule built by Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) of Hawthorne  Calif   which docked at the space station May 25 	2	1	2
"I was pretty fortunate — I arrived and then four days later  Dragon showed up  and so it was a real busy time for my first part of the increment  Acaba said  ""It was very nice to be part of that first docking of a commercial vehicle  and we really enjoyed it  and it was a great milestone "" [Video: Joe Acaba Encounters 'The Avengers' and Dragon in Space]"	3	4	1
"But it wasn't all work and no play in space  Acaba was the mastermind behind the plan to screen the movie ""The Avengers"" on the space station while he was there  A self-professed comics fan  the astronaut worked with NASA  Marvel Comics and Disney to uplink the film to the orbiting outpost in June "	2	2	1
"It's really nice to have a movie night  Acaba said  ""As a crew  we're very integrated  Just like here on Earth  whenever you can get together with family and friends to watch a movie or whatever it may be  it's pretty special  so we enjoyed the movie and we just enjoyed spending time together """	2	3	1
The astronaut gave the movie high grades 	1	3	1
"I was a math and science teacher out in Florida  and I think the teaching profession really gets you pretty well qualified to become an astronaut  Acaba said  ""It may not seem that way  but schoolteachers every day  they're in a stressful environment  every day is different  and you need to cope with a wide range of people and different experiences """	2	2	2
Avian malaria spreads north into interior Alaska: study	1	1	2
ANCHORAGE  Alaska (Reuters) - Malaria is infecting birds as far north as Alaska's interior  and a rapidly warming climate may be the reason the mosquito-borne disease appears to be advancing northward  a new study shows 	1	1	2
It is the first time scientists have detected the transmission of avian malaria in local birds at such far-north latitudes anywhere in North America  said the study  published on Wednesday in the scientific journal PLOS One 	1	1	1
We now have shown that malaria is being transmitted in Alaska  said Ravinder Sehgal  a San Francisco State University biologist and a lead researcher on the project 	2	1	1
While tropical birds that migrate to Alaska in the summer are known to carry the disease  there had never been any documented cases of it spreading to non-migratory Alaska birds or birds newly hatched in Alaska that had not yet flown south  Sehgal said 	1	1	1
Longer periods of warm weather in the summer may be allowing the malaria parasite to thrive in Alaska and be transmitted by mosquitoes  Sehgal said 	1	1	1
The question was  how far north is it getting  and is it going to get to birds that have never expressed it? he said 	1	1	1
The study notes that temperatures have been increasing in the Arctic at almost twice the average global rate  and that the warming climate has changed vegetation in the far north 	1	1	2
The study evaluated blood samples taken last year from birds in Anchorage  Fairbanks and Coldfoot  a community north of the Arctic Circle 	1	1	1
The researchers found avian malaria in resident and hatch-year birds in Anchorage and Fairbanks  though not as far north as Coldfoot 	1	1	1
Of 676 birds tested  7 2 percent were found to be infected 	1	1	2
Some of the hardest-hit birds were black-capped chickadees  Sehgal said 	2	1	2
Of the black-capped chickadees tested in Anchorage  about 30 percent were infected 	1	1	2
Further studies are underway to try to determine what type of mosquito might be spreading the disease  Sehgal said 	1	1	2
For some species elsewhere  malaria transmissions are devastating  Sehgal said 	2	1	3
Penguins  which have no natural defenses against malaria  die when they are infected in zoos  he said 	1	1	3
Malaria also has seriously damaged bird populations in Hawaii  where non-native mosquitoes have been introduced to the habitat 	1	1	3
But Alaskans need not fear for their health  Sehgal said 	2	2	1
The study detected only avian malaria  which is different from the type of malaria that afflicts mammals 	1	1	1
Certainly  it is not going to spread to humans  he said 	2	2	1
It came two weeks after protesters and police clashed in the city centre for the first time since last year  following months of demonstrations in other parts of Manama and elsewhere in the country 	1	1	2
Rioters hurled petrol bombs  iron rods and stones  endangering both the police and civilians in the area  the government Information Affairs Authority said in an emailed statement 	1	1	3
"The statement added that police ""used only the necessary force to restore order""  that the 29 people arrested would be referred to the public prosecutor "	1	1	1
It said there would be an investigation to identify others involved in the protest 	1	1	1

Bahraini protesters and police clash after funeral	2	1	3
MANAMA (Reuters) - Bahraini protesters threw petrol bombs and stones on Tuesday at riot police who were trying to disperse them with water cannons after the funeral of a Shi'ite man jailed for his role in last year's pro-democracy uprising  witnesses said 	1	1	4
Due to his medical condition  his lawyer had tried more than once     to ensure adequate medical attention for him  but the prison authorities failed to provide such attention  said Mohammed al-Maskati  head of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights 	3	1	3
"Mushaima was jailed for seven years in March 2011 for ""vandalism  rioting  assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest""  one of hundreds of people who were arrested in weeks of mass protests inspired by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt "	1	1	4
Despite that crackdown and two months of martial law that followed  clashes between police and protesters still occur almost daily in Bahrain  where the U S  Fifth Fleet is based  On Friday  a 17-year-old died in a confrontation with riot police 	2	1	4
Shi'ites complain of discrimination in the electoral system  jobs  housing  education and government departments including the police and army  They say government assertions that it is addressing those concerns have produced no action 	1	1	3
A commission of international legal experts reported in November that torture had been systematically used on protesters to punish and extract hundreds of confessions  Among its many recommendations were reviewing activists' jail sentences 	2	2	4
Witnesses said thousands of people  mostly Shi'ites  had gathered for Mushaima's funeral on Tuesday  which passed peacefully 	2	2	2
They said clashes erupted afterwards when police stopped hundreds of people trying to march to the Pearl Roundabout  the center of last year's uprising 	1	1	3
The medics were freed from detention last year after an outcry over allegations of torture 	1	2	3
Ali al-Ekry  former senior surgeon at the Salmaniya hospital in Manama  was sentenced in June to five years in jail  Eight other medics received prison sentences ranging from one month to three years  and nine people were acquitted 	1	1	3
The charges included inciting hatred and calling for the overthrow of Bahrain's rulers 	1	1	3
"The World Medical Association  a confederation of 100 national medical associations  said the verdicts were ""unacceptable"" and urged Bahrain to drop the sentences "	3	1	2
Despite the government's claims that the medics committed a criminal offence  Amnesty International believes they have been jailed solely for peacefully exercising their legitimate rights to freedom of expression  association and assembly  said Ann Harrison  program director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International 	1	1	2
Bahraini officials could not be reached immediately for comment on the cases 	1	1	1
The government has denounced the protest movement as sectarian and part of a quest by Shi'ite Iran to dominate the region  Iran denies involvement and Bahraini Shi'ites deny being steered from Tehran 	2	1	3
Bahraini teenager killed in Friday's protest	1	1	4
DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahraini riot police killed a teenager when they fired shotgun pellets during clashes with protesters following a demonstration on Friday  the country's opposition said on Saturday  the second young protester to die in six weeks 	1	1	4
"The police described the incident after the protest as a ""terrorist attack"" on a security patrol that ""targeted the lives of members of the patrol"" late on Friday evening "	2	1	3
"The police had defended themselves ""according to their legal authority""  a statement said  confirming one of the protesters had died "	2	1	3
The protests were put down by the Sunni monarchy which imposed martial law and invited Saudi Arabia to send troops in support 	1	1	2

The Interior Ministry says protesters have injured more than 700 police officers and that the authorities have exercised restraint 	2	1	3
The pictures could not be independently verified 	1	1	1

The country's mostly state-owned distribution utilities are drowning in losses and were blamed for triggering probably the worst blackout in history in July  when power was cut for two consecutive days in a massive area home to 670 million people 	3	1	2
The federal cabinet will consider the bailout plan  the second in a decade  when it meets at 5 30 pm (8 a m 	1	1	1
EDT) on Monday  officials said 	1	1	1
Shares in some Indian power sector lenders and power producers rose 2-3 percent on hopes that the cabinet would approve the plan  the latest in a series of actions to address structural problems slowing down Asia's third largest economy 	1	2	2
A lifeline for power distributors would free up cash and help them buy more power to supply factories and homes that resort to expensive diesel generators and solar panels to plug their energy gaps 	2	2	1
Last week  the government cut subsidies on diesel and opened up the country's vast retail sector as well as aviation to foreign investment to win back investor confidence and attack the country's ballooning fiscal deficit 	2	1	1
"Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  defending the measures  said ""money does not grow on trees"" and that failure to bridge the gap between government spending and income would stoke inflation and lead to further loss of confidence in the economy "	3	1	2
Under the rescue plan for power distributors  provincial governments will take on half of their short-term debt and convert them into long-term bonds over the next three years 	1	1	1
Lenders  who are mostly government-run banks  will be asked to turn the rest into long-term loans and offer a moratorium on repayment of the principal for three years 	2	1	1
But they will not be expected to reduce interest rates on the restructured loans  Montek Singh Ahluwalia  the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission  said 	1	1	1
The debt restructuring  as it stands  appears largely a breather as it is not accompanied by any concrete reform measures  said Kameswara Rao  a partner at consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers 	3	1	1
The country's largest lender  State Bank of India   and leading private banks have no exposure to the distributors  according to the report 	1	1	1
The restructuring could worsen their (banks') asset liability mismatch  Rao warned 	3	1	2
That is because banks will have to wait longer to be paid back  hampering their ability to repay short-term liabilities 	1	1	2
Under political pressure to sell below cost and losing more than a quarter of power supply to theft and decrepit networks  distribution companies have been borrowing for years to fund their losses 	1	1	3
Just seven of the country's 28 states - Rajasthan  Uttar Pradesh  Haryana  Tamil Nadu  Punjab  Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh - have between them accumulated short-term debt of 1 9 trillion rupees ($35 6 billion) from power distribution 	1	1	2
Baltimore police uncover 1951 Renoir theft report	1	1	1
WASHINGTON (AP) — Police have located a 1951 theft report from the Baltimore Museum of Art of a Renoir painting matching the description of one that turned up recently at a West Virginia flea market 	1	1	1
The report from Nov  17  1951  was uncovered Friday 	1	1	1
It says there was no evidence of forced entry at the museum 	2	1	1
A Virginia woman bought the painting for $7 at the flea market in 2010 	1	1	1
It was expected to fetch $75 000 at a now-postponed auction 	1	1	1
Museum officials were combing through paper records to learn more about the theft 	1	1	1
So far  they have found a record documenting the painting was on loan from art patron Saidie A  May 	1	1	1
Before the police report  it was the only record of the painting being stolen 	1	1	1
Bank of England unanimous on rates  stimulus	1	1	1
LONDON (AP) — The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee was unanimous this month in keeping the interest rates and the economic stimulus program unchanged 	1	1	1
Minutes of the MPC meeting released Wednesday show all but one of its nine members are open to another increase in the stimulus program — called quantitative easing — in coming months 	1	1	1
Many analysts believe the Bank will increase the stimulus program above the current 375 billion pounds ($610 billion) in November 	1	1	1
The minutes showed the committee is waiting to gauge the effectiveness of a new 80 billion pounds Funding for Lending program 	1	1	1
The minutes said the success of the program  meant to boost credit  was difficult to predict because of heightened uncertainty  mainly in the eurozone  and the reluctance of U K  households and businesses to spend 	1	2	2
Barbra Streisand helps honor Marvin Hamlisch in NY	1	2	1
"Minnelli sang ""If You Really Knew Me"" from the musical ""They're Playing My Song """	1	1	1
"Franklin gave a soulful rendition of ""Nobody Does It Better"" from the James Bond film ""The Spy Who Loved Me "" Streisand brought the crowd to its feet when she finished ""The Way We Were"" from the film of the same name "	1	3	1
The memorial took place Tuesday in a theater at The Juilliard School  where Hamlisch became the youngest person accepted at age 7 	1	2	1
He won three Oscars  four Emmys  four Grammys  a Tony  a Pulitzer and two Golden Globes 	1	3	1

Beagle survives 70-foot fall from NJ bridge	1	3	2
BURLINGTON TOWNSHIP  N J  (AP) — A beagle named Brandi survived a 70-foot fall from a New Jersey bridge 	1	3	2
The dog got away from its owner during a walk along the Burlington Riverfront Promenade Friday night 	1	1	2
Bridge officer Rob Bittner saw Brandi walking up the Burlington-Bristol Bridge toward Pennsylvania 	1	1	1
Bittner tells The Courier-Post of Cherry Hill (http://on cpsj com/Ps9e2y ) he turned on his emergency lights to slow traffic and followed the dog 	2	1	2
The officer says Brandi jumped into the Delaware River as motorists tried to grab her 	2	1	3
The beagle's owner recovered her and took her to a veterinarian 	1	3	1
Brandi was bruised around the abdomen  but didn't have any broken bones 	1	2	2
As if the task of competing with Apple’s (AAPL) new iPhone 5 isn’t daunting enough  Samsung (005930) has chosen an interesting approach to promoting its flagship Galaxy S III smartphone in the U S  that inadvertently brings a new rival into the mix: Facebook (FB)  As dominant as Apple is in the mobile industry — the company accounted for 77% of all mobile industry profits last quarter — Facebook is equally in command of the social space  But nevertheless  Samsung’s recent promotional efforts in the U S  take aim squarely at one of Facebook’s key features 	2	2	1
Samsung’s Galaxy S III has definitely found success in North America thus far  Alongside a recent announcement that the flagship smartphone sold 20 million units in its first 100 days of availability  Samsung noted that it sold 4 million units in North America during that time period  While that figure pales in comparison to Apple’s iPhone sales  the Galaxy S III is just one smartphone in Samsung’s arsenal and 4 million units is nothing to scoff at 	2	3	1
The handset’s continued success relies on a number of factors  however  Ongoing support from carriers’ in-store sales staff is always important  but marketing and advertising obviously play a huge role in generating consumer awareness and interest 	1	2	1
In Samsung’s most recent ad run for the Galaxy S III  the company focuses on one feature in particular  Dubbed “Share Shot ” the nifty function creates a series of Wi-Fi Direct connections that allow users to instantly and automatically share photos they take with their friends who are nearby  The feature requires a Galaxy S III be used on both sides of the connection — sending photos and receiving photos — but it will be included in additional Samsung phones set to launch later this year 	1	1	1
Share Shot can be a bit tricky to set up at first  but in my tests it worked well on Samsung’s Galaxy S III  All else aside  however  the question remains: Is Share Shot the answer to a question no one is asking?	2	2	2
Now  whether or not Samsung intended to compete with Facebook  Share Shot is direct competition with Facebook’s photo-sharing features and with Instagram  The problem  however  is that while Share Shot is technologically far more advanced than anything Facebook offers  it is far less social 	2	3	2
When users share images via Share Shot  each of their nearby friends (who use a compatible device and who have configured the feature) will instantly receive a copy of each image taken on his or her phone  It has been shared  This means that if the user decides to share a photo later using Facebook or Instagram  it is no longer novel for friends who had previously used Share Shot 	1	1	2
Photos shared using Share Shot are also only visible to those users in close proximity to the source phone  No other friends can see these photos unless they are re-shared on a more widely available network  Share Shot also doesn’t support commenting — and we all know how much people love to comment on photos — or re-sharing without the use of a third-party app 	1	1	1
In the end  Share Shot is a social feature that isn’t very social at all 	2	1	2
Samsung’s recent iPhone 5 attack ad is another perfect example of this  Going on the offensive and telling people why they should choose the Galaxy S III over the iPhone 5 is a fantastic idea  Listing trivial or unknown features like “Shake To Update” and “Palm Touch Mute Pause” as reasons people should buy the Galaxy S III over the iPhone 5  however  is not 	2	2	2
Samsung is doing a great job of building phones that carriers want and that consumers want  It sold more than 50 million smartphones into channels last quarter and it had a formula that was really working  But that formula seemed to involve saturating the market with models of all shapes more than it involved creating strong differentiated experiences 	2	4	1
In a recent interview  however  Samsung’s marketing boss pointed out that the company is hoping to change that  “Especially in U S   people are obsessed with Apple ” Samsung’s Younghee Lee said earlier this year  “It’s time to change people’s attention ”	2	2	1
Beer flows as Germany kicks off Oktoberfest	1	1	1
BERLIN (AP) — The mayor of Munich has tapped the first keg of beer to kick off the 179th traditional German folk festival Oktoberfest 	1	2	1
"With only two blows of his hammer and a cry of ""O'zapft is"" — ""It's Tapped"" — Mayor Christian Ude inserted the first tap into the first keg as the festival opened Saturday "	1	1	1
More than six million guests from around the world are expected to descend on the beer tents of Munich to celebrate Oktoberfest through October 7 	1	2	1
Last year's visitors consumed almost 8 million 2-pint (1-liter) mugs of beer 	1	1	1

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The surreptitious video recording of a fundraiser held for Republican Mitt Romney in May provided a rare glimpse of how he views supporters of President Barack Obama - as government dependents 	3	1	3
"I said to him  'How are we perceived around the world?'	3	1	1
84 behind-closed-doors-romney-gossips-imitates-kissinger-011602149 And he said one word: 'Veak!'"	3	1	2
The secretly filmed recording  released in its entirety by the liberal Mother Jones magazine on Tuesday  opened a window on how Romney acts during the kind of private meeting with donors that is helping to propel the most expensive presidential campaign in U S  history 	2	2	2
In this case the former Massachusetts governor and private equity executive was speaking to donors who paid $50 000 each for the privilege of his company at a private dinner at the Boca Raton  Florida  home of financier Marc Leder 	1	1	1
You're not eating  Romney scolded one attendee during his remarks at the fundraiser 	3	3	1
At one point  Romney decided to give the donor a lesson in eating 	3	2	1
You take this  your fork  and you put it in  Romney said 	3	3	1
When asked about Democrats' criticisms of his tenure as a wealthy executive at Bain Capital  Romney pretended to plead poverty 	3	2	2
I'm poor as a church mouse  said Romney  who has an estimated fortune of $250 million 	3	2	2
NOT UP FOR 'SLAPSTICK'	1	2	1
"Romney said he preferred Jay Leno  host of NBC's ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno """	3	2	1
By coincidence  a few hours after the video's release online  Obama arrived in New York City to tape an interview with Letterman 	2	2	1
Days before the election in 2008  Republican presidential candidate John McCain and his running mate  Sarah Palin  flew to New York to be on the show 	2	1	1
'ISLAMICS DO NOT WANT TO VOTE FOR YOU'	2	1	2
At the Florida fundraiser  Romney's comments were captured by a videocamera that had been placed on what appeared to be a marble bar 	2	1	1
Waiters wearing white gloves were seen serving the guests red wine from decanters 	1	1	1
For most of the video  only the backs of donors' heads can be seen  with Romney in profile 	2	1	1
The audio does  however  pick up donors' comments to Romney  including some good-natured ribbing about his image on the campaign trail 	2	2	1
They say  'He's a rich boy ' one donor affably told Romney during the dinner 	3	3	1
The comments reflected donors' anxieties about Romney's perceived deficiencies 	3	2	1
One donor complained of the difficulties of converting Obama supporters to Romney's side 	2	1	2
Right now I'm very concerned  she said 	3	1	3
Why don't you stick up for yourself? a male donor asked Romney 	3	2	2
You have to show your face more on TV  said another 	3	2	2
When Romney responded to their reservations by telling the guests about the importance of his three debates against Obama in October  a donor cut him off 	3	2	1
You will do so well  the donor said 	3	3	1
Your debates are incredible 	3	3	1
Behind the Social Media Campaigns of Obama and Romney	1	1	1
With about five weeks left until the 2012 presidential election  both Democrats and Republicans are kicking their campaigns into high gear 	2	1	1
As more potential voters turn to the Internet to stay connected -- and less are catching political TV spots -- the need to leverage social media to hit respective audiences has never been greater 	2	1	1
But the payoff could be huge for either party 	3	1	2
The force behind the campaign for Republican candidate Mitt Romney includes a digital rapid response department that works alongside the communications team at its Boston headquarters 	1	1	1
There is a higher level of expectation for speed than in past elections for getting information out  and the campaigns have to be that much faster  whether it's through mobile or social media sites such as Google+  Facebook and Twitter  Moffatt said 	3	1	1
To manage the flow  the team went from 14 staffers in the primaries to about 120 people 	1	1	1
The campaign keeps an eye on social media sentiment and what people are saying  from voters to journalists 	1	1	1
About 6 million people are already connecting to Romney's campaign on social media sites 	1	2	1
We are always monitoring the online audience  but it's hard to measure success right now  he said 	2	2	2
"There are about six million people connected to the campaign on social media sites right now  and we know people are engaged	3	2	1
85 behind-social-media-campaigns-obama-romney-104608266 We need to keep that engagement thriving "	3	1	1
To do so  Moffatt said the team is about to work even harder in the days leading up to the debates and Election Day 	1	2	1
His day begins at about 7 a m  with a series of conference calls and meetings that conclude around 9 a m 	1	1	1
The meetings don't pick up again until about 11 a m 	2	1	2
across different states and departments  and then momentum builds throughout the day as projects in need of approval pour in 	2	1	2
On a good day  things wrap around 8 p m 	3	2	2
There have been a lot of really late nights  Moffatt said  adding that he's relied on Diet Coke to make it through the sleepiest of times 	2	1	2
"Fortunately  I don't have to travel that much -- it's far more time-efficient not to travel and just get work done at the office	3	2	1
85 behind-social-media-campaigns-obama-romney-104608266 Plus  I have a young daughter at home  so I like to be as close as possible to my family "	3	2	1
"Moffatt said his team has become especially close throughout the entire process  noting that many even went to his wedding: ""When you spend so much time doing what you do for work  it's important to have the right people around you "" he said "	3	2	1
As time rolls closer to Election Day  millions of people will start to visit the website in the next 30 days  coupled with the 6 million people already engaging on Facebook and Twitter  so the team is about to ramp up efforts now more than ever 	2	1	1
When we get into the final stage  we will work with state teams for volunteers who do door-knocking and boast up our online strategy about eight times more  Moffatt said 	2	2	1
We are moving into a phase of mobilization where every day is important 	2	2	1
I also want to spend more time with my young daughter and my wife 	3	2	2
Meanwhile  President Obama's team is also keeping social media top of mind throughout the campaign 	2	1	1
As we push through the few weeks of this election  social media is one important way we can keep a conversation going with our supporters and undecided voters across the country about the clear choice Americans face in this election -- between the President's plan to keep moving forward with an economy built on a strong middle class  and Mitt Romney's plan to go back to the same failed policies of the past  Obama spokesperson Adam Fetcher told Mashable 	4	2	2
Those behind Obama's social media strategy are clearly sharp and quick  too: It didn’t take long for Obama to react to Clint Eastwood’s “Invisible Obama” routine  which took place at the 2012 Republican National Convention last month and became a meme that spread like wildfire across the Internet 	3	2	2
Obama tweeted a picture -- sent from the  BarackObama account  run by his campaign -- of him sitting in a chair marked “the President ”	1	1	1
Many applauded the campaign's use of social media to respond quickly to what was happening 	1	2	1
"In addition  Obama received national attention for participating in an ""Ask Me Anything"" Q&A session on popular site Reddit "	2	2	1
Social media is also being blended into other strategies  including mobile 	1	2	1
The campaign is using a Dashboard tool for supporters and volunteers  so they can get all of the necessary information to become engaged with the campaign  both online and offline 	1	2	1
This eliminates duplication and redundancy  and volunteers can share their progress with others on Facebook and Twitter along the way 	1	2	1
Belarus holds elections boycotted by opposition	1	1	2
MINSK  Belarus (AP) — Belarus is holding parliamentary elections Sunday without the main opposition parties  which boycotted the vote because of complaints over the detention of political prisoners and opportunities for election fraud 	1	1	3
The election must fill 110 seats in parliament  which long has been reduced to a rubber stamp by authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko 	2	1	2
Western observers have criticized all recent elections in Belarus as undemocratic 	1	1	2
The U S  and EU have imposed economic and travel sanctions on Lukashenko's government over its crackdown on opposition groups and independent media 	1	1	2
Bergeron's late TD lifts No  12 Texas 41-36	1	1	1
(AP) — David Ash threw three touchdown passes to Jaxon Shipley and Joe Bergeron scored on a 2-yard run with 29 seconds left to lift No  12 Texas to a 41-36 win against Oklahoma State on Saturday night 	1	1	1
Ash connected with tight end D J  Grant for a 29-yard pick up on fourth-and-4 to keep the drive going  and then Mike Davis outleaped Justin Gilbert on a 32-yard deep ball to set up Bergeron's winning touchdown 	1	2	1
Ash finished with 304 yards passing and his first interception of the season 	1	2	1
J W  Walsh started in place of injured Oklahoma State quarterback Wes Lunt and threw for 307 yards and two touchdowns 	1	2	1
Bernanke makes strong defense of Fed rate policies	2	1	1
WASHINGTON (AP) — Chairman Ben Bernanke offered a sharp defense Monday of the Federal Reserve's bold policies to stimulate the weak economy  while cautioning Congress to respect its private discussions 	2	2	2
The Fed needs to drive down borrowing rates low because the economy isn't growing fast enough to reduce high unemployment  Bernanke said in a speech to the Indiana Economics Club 	3	1	2
The unemployment rate is 8 1 percent 	1	1	1
Low rates could help lower the federal budget deficit by reducing the government's borrowing costs and generating more tax revenue through stronger growth  Bernanke said 	2	2	1
Bernanke also cautioned Congress against changing the law so it could review the Fed's interest-rate policy discussions 	2	1	1
Such a step would improperly inject political pressure into those talks and make Fed policymakers less likely to act  Bernanke warns 	2	1	2
The speech comes just weeks after the Fed voted at its Sept  12-13 meeting to purchase mortgage bonds to help boost the housing market 	1	2	1
The Fed left the program open ended  saying that it would keep buying the bonds until the job market showed substantial improvement 	2	2	1
Bernanke spoke two days before President Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney will hold a debate in which the economy is a central theme 	1	1	1
And his speech comes four days before the government releases its September job figures 	1	1	1
Economists expect just modest hiring gains and continued unemployment above 8 percent 	1	2	2
The U S  economy is struggling more than three years after the Great Recession ended 	1	1	2
High unemployment and weak pay growth has made consumers more cautious about spending  which has hurt manufacturing and slowed broader growth 	3	1	2
The Fed is hoping to make home buying more attractive to help the broader economy 	2	2	1
When home prices rise  people typically feel wealthier and spend more 	1	2	1
Beta Blockers May Not Prevent Heart Attacks and Strokes	2	1	3
New research suggests that beta-blocker pills don't prevent heart attacks  strokes or cardiac deaths in patients with heart disease  but doctors are torn over whether there's enough in the study to make them want to stop prescribing the drugs 	3	1	4
Beta blockers have been a standard heart medication for decades 	2	2	2
This is a very compelling study that has the potential to shake up the conventional wisdom that exists regarding the role of beta blockers in the management of patients with cardiovascular disease  said Dr  Randal Thomas  a cardiovascular specialist at the Mayo Clinic 	3	2	2
At a minimum  it will lead to new studies that address this issue once again 	3	1	1
Beta blockers work by blocking adrenalin receptors in the brain that become activated when the body is stressed 	1	2	2
"Some doctors say they are glad beta blockers are being questioned because their use had been ""written in stone"" for so many years  but others say using a non-randomized data sample is not as reliable as a randomized drug trial "	3	2	2
While the authors attempted to account for differences between the patient groups that might have had an impact on their health  they did not have access to information on why some patients were prescribed these drugs and some were not  said Dr  Richard Besser  the chief heath and medical editor at ABC News 	3	2	2
Rubenfire also weans patients off the pills 18 months after they have a heart attack if they experience adverse side effects  such as fatigue and erectile dysfunction 	2	2	3
Rubenfire said the existing data wasn't enough to determine which patients would benefit from beta blockers  and what kinds of beta blockers are better than others 	3	2	2
Beta blockers include at least six brand names  including Sectral  Tenormin and Zebeta 	1	1	1
"Even study coauthor Christopher Cannon  a professor at Harvard Medical School  said he will continue to prescribe beta blockers to his patients  adding ""I would not make too much of this"" because the study is only observational "	2	2	2
All it can do is raise up an idea for us researchers to consider for further study  he said 	2	2	2
Since patients are often taking several drugs  it's hard to pinpoint how much one agent helps compared with another 	2	1	1
Dr  Steven Nissen  who chairs the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation  said the medicine might not be ideal for all of the patients it's prescribed to  but a new randomized  controlled trial will be necessary to change guidelines for prescribing beta blockers 	2	2	2
Abandonment of this type of therapy for post-MI [post-heart attack] patients based upon an observational study is not warranted  he said 	3	2	2
Kumhulz said  noting that beta-blocker patients didn't have better outcomes than the other patients did after the first year 	3	1	3
The study cannot definitively answer that question -- but raises doubts about the need to continue to take them for the rest of a patient's life 	3	1	2
Beware Rogue Online Pharmacies  FDA Says	2	1	2
Shopping online is the way of the world these days  but not all e-commerce transactions are created equal 	2	1	1
Buying a sauté pan on Amazon?	1	1	1
Not a risky venture 	2	1	1
Buying antibiotics from an online pharmacy that didn’t ask for a prescription?	1	1	1
You’re asking for trouble 	3	1	2
Many online pharmacies are fake  the agency says  selling medications that may make you sick 	1	1	2
“Buying medicines from rogue online pharmacies can be risky because they may sell fake  expired  contaminated  not approved by FDA  or otherwise unsafe products that are dangerous to patients ” FDA commissioner Dr  Margaret Hamburg  said in a news release 	1	1	2
“Fraudulent and illegal online pharmacies often offer deeply discounted products ”	2	1	2
Bottom line: if prices for prescription meds sound too good to be true  they probably are 	3	1	1
Almost 25 percent of people who shop on the Internet have bought prescription drugs online  the FDA says 	1	1	1
And 30 percent of those people said they weren’t sure about how to safely purchase medication that way 	1	1	2
They’ll need to come up to speed quickly  since the National Association of Board of Pharmacy says that less than 3 percent of online pharmacies are in line with federal and state laws 	2	1	1
While the FDA didn’t say if online prescription drug shopping has increased  some other recent statistics may shed some light on the issue 	1	1	1
A recent study in the journal ACS Chemical Neuroscience found that a record 4 02 billion prescriptions were written in 2011  up from 3 99 billion in 2010 	1	1	1
But Americans are having more trouble paying for those drugs 	1	1	2
Consumer Reports said recently that a struggling economy is forcing more Americans to cut back on healthcare needs  including skimping on medications 	1	1	2
Some tips: a legit pharmacy will ask for a valid medical prescription from a doctor or other healthcare professional  a licensed pharmacist will be available for questions  and it will be licensed by the state board of pharmacy 	3	1	1

BFI to invest $810 million in UK film over 5 years	1	1	1
LONDON (Reuters) - The British Film Institute (BFI) will invest nearly 500 million pounds ($810 million) over the next five years in a bid to boost the industry and build audiences  it announced on Wednesday 	2	2	1
"Under the title ""Film Forever: Supporting UK Film 2012-2017""  the initiative will involve spending 44 2 million pounds a year on education and audiences  32 3 million annually on film and film making and 9 9 million a year on film heritage "	1	1	1
Film Forever is founded on a renewed commitment to the future - the future generation of audiences  the future generation of film makers and the opportunities presented by digital technologies  said BFI CEO Amanda Nevill 	2	1	1
To help build audiences  the BFI is concentrating on eight to 10 regional hubs outside London  equipping 1 000 community venues across Britain and working with Samsung to develop a Smart TV app providing BFI content 	2	2	1
Every five to 19-year-old will be offered a film education  and the BFI also aims to develop a new youth film Academy with the help of Pinewood Studios and BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) 	1	2	1
Direct support for British film will come in the form of more money for production and development  rising to 24 million pounds by 2017 from 18 million in 2012  as well as a new talent network and BFI Film Skills Fund 	1	1	1
The British film industry contributes 1 6 billion pounds a year to national GDP  according to a recent report from Oxford Economics 	1	1	1
The same study estimated that  including indirect employment  tourism  trade and merchandise  the figure rises to more than 4 6 billion pounds 	2	1	1
Biogen's hemophilia drug meets late-stage trial goal	1	1	1
(Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc said on Wednesday its experimental treatment for patients with Hemophilia B  a rare inherited blood disorder that impairs blood coagulation  met the main goal of controlling bleeding in a late-stage trial 	2	2	2
A single injection of the long-lasting clotting factor  being developed in partnership with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum  controlled bleeding in 90 4 percent of all bleeding episodes 	1	1	1
Biogen  whose shares rose as much as 2 7 percent initially  said it plans to submit an approval application to the U S  Food and Drug Administration in the first half of 2013 	2	2	1
The study  known as B-LONG  enrolled 123 male patients age 12 and older  divided into four groups that were treated at different intervals 	1	1	1
Overall  93 5 percent of patients completed the study 	1	1	1
The companies said the treatment was generally well tolerated  but one serious side effect was reported 	2	3	2
The most common side effects were nasopharyngitis  influenza  joint pain  upper respiratory infection  hypertension and headache 	2	1	2
They said they expect to file an application with European health authorities after completion of a study in children younger than 12 years old  as required by the European Medicines Agency 	2	1	1

BlackRock raises S&P 500 target  but says rally over	2	3	2
NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc   one of the world's largest asset managers  has raised its expectations for the U S  stock market in 2012 but believes this year's equity rally has run its course  according to targets provided by the firm on Tuesday 	2	3	2
The Standard & Poor's 500 < SPX> will finish 2012 at 1 450 and rise to 1 525 by middle of 2013  according to Chris Leavy  BlackRock's chief investment officer  fundamental equities of the Americas 	2	2	1
The new targets are an increase from the firm's earlier forecasts and reflect a 7 percent rally in the benchmark index since early August 	2	2	1
Earlier  the firm projected the S&P would finish the year at 1 350 and rise to 1 400 by mid-2013 	2	2	1

Bodies moved from Kenya mass graves  police suspect	1	1	2
MOMBASA (Reuters) - Bodies may have been moved from mass graves in Kenya to prevent an investigation into a suspected slaughter of villagers during inter-tribal unrest in the Tana River region  police said 	1	1	3
The scale of the unrest has left many Kenyans convinced it was politically instigated and has raised fears of serious tribal fighting before elections due in March 	2	1	2
The Kenya Red Cross said at least 20 people believed to have been killed were still unaccounted for  and they suspected their bodies had been buried in the graves 	1	1	3
Regional police chief Aggrey Adoli said only a human foot and human skin had been found after two hours of digging  however 	1	1	2
"The whole place appeared freshly dug and was exuding the stench of rotten flesh     we all were surprised when nothing was found	3	1	3
94 bodies-moved-kenya-mass-graves-police-suspect-102953458 Those who removed the bodies must have been striving to hide some evidence  he said by telephone late on Thursday "	3	1	2
It is possible that the graves might have been tampered with and bodies removed before police arrived at the scene to seal it off  Adoli said 	2	1	2

BoE's Fisher - new scheme will boost credit supply	1	1	1
LONDON (Reuters) - A Bank of England scheme to give lenders cheap funding will boost credit supply to the recession-hit economy as the majority of Britain's big banks have signed up  central banker Paul Fisher said on Tuesday 	2	2	3
The rate-setter also sounded a note of cautious optimism about the European Central Bank's recent steps to calm the euro zone debt crisis  though he urged European governments to use the opportunity to find a lasting fix to the crisis  which the BoE sees as one of the main drags on the British economy 	2	2	4
Britain's government and central bank started the new scheme in August  hoping to remove one of the obstacles to economic recovery by offering cheap funds to lower banks' funding costs 	2	2	3
I am confident that the FLS (Funding for Lending Scheme) will help the supply of credit  Fisher said in a speech 	2	2	2
Before its introduction  it was more likely than not that the stock of credit would contract further over the next 18 months 	2	2	1
Fisher said that 13 lenders had signed up for the scheme  representing 73 percent of the stock of lending to households and companies  as of the end of June 	2	1	1
A significant number of other institutions were close to signing up too  he added 	2	1	1
Under the scheme  banks and building societies can borrow up to 5 percent of their stock of existing lending from the BoE  plus any expansion of its lending during the period between the end of June and the end of 2013 	1	1	1
With some 1 2 trillion pounds of lending to firms and households on their books  the banks currently participating could tap a total of around 60 billion pounds in cheap funds  compared to some 80 billion if all banks took part 	1	1	1
Fisher said five of Britain's six largest banks had signed up for the scheme 	2	1	1
CALMER MARKETS	1	1	1
Some BoE policymakers have indicated that they believe the funding for lending scheme could be a better way to get a recovery going than further purchases of government bonds with newly created money 	2	2	2
Most economists still expect another dose of quantitative easing asset buys once the current 50 billion-pound round is completed in November 	2	2	2
However  Crowe was sceptical about the overall impact of the scheme 	2	1	3
We do not think that banks will substantially relax lending standards to promote new lending  he said 	2	1	2
Previous schemes to spur lending since the financial crisis have failed to give a clear boost to the economy 	2	1	3
The government has also launched a state-backed business bank to provide more loans to smaller companies 	1	2	1
Over time  the Funding for Lending Scheme will improve lending conditions  though it is too early to measure any impact yet  the BBA said  adding that the weakness in the economy may well be the reason why companies were reluctant to borrow 	2	1	2
The BoE has said the cost of loans and tighter credit conditions are a major reason for the lack of lending  blaming the euro zone debt crisis for a rise in banks' funding costs 	2	1	3
The ECB's recent decision to buy bonds from countries like Italy and Spain had improved market sentiment  Fisher said 	2	2	2
I would caution  however  that we have been here before  he said 	3	1	3
Along with every other market participant I hope that this time will be different 	3	1	2
Politicians now had to use the time provided by the central bank's action to take the necessary steps such as improving the competitiveness of southern European countries  he said 	2	1	2

Bonnie  Clyde guns stay together after high bidder pays 311 900 pounds	1	2	2

They're still iconic and their love story kind of resonates  said Bobby Livingston  vice president of RR Auction  the company that conducted the sale 	2	3	1
We have a romanticized vision of Bonnie and Clyde 	2	2	2
The duo were believed to have committed 13 murders and numerous bank robberies  kidnappings and car thefts during a cross-country crime spree from 1932 to 1934 	2	1	4
Their fame was heightened by their practice of leaving glamorous photos of themselves at crime scenes  including one of Parker smoking a cigar 	2	2	2
"A popular 1967 movie  ""Bonnie and Clyde "" a somewhat romanticized account of the couple's career starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway  was critically acclaimed for its frank presentation of sex and violence "	2	2	3

They were also suspected of staging a prison break in Waldo  Texas  that left two prison guards dead in 1934 	2	1	3

BP spill settlement talks stall as U S  demands $18 billion: paper	1	1	2
LONDON (Reuters) - Talks between BP and the U S  government over a settlement for the 2010 oil spill have stalled because the U S  is insisting that the British oil giant pay at least $18 billion  British newspaper the Sunday Times reported 	1	1	2
A settlement deal may not happen until early next year  the newspaper quoted sources close to the company as saying 	1	1	1

BP  which declined to comment on the story  has always denied any liability for the United States' worst offshore environmental disaster 	1	1	3

Bradley and Mickelson become Ryder Cup rock stars	1	1	1
With three wins from three matches at stately Medinah Country Club  Mickelson and Bradley have become Ryder Cup rock stars whipping the massive galleries into a frenzy with every high-five and fist-pump 	2	2	1
Europe has produced the Ryder Cup's most memorable and enduring partnerships with the pairing of Spanish giants Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal at the top of the list 	2	2	1
Olazabal  Europe's captain at Medinah and Ballesteros  who died of brain cancer a year ago but remains the inspirational touchstone for Europeans  formed an almost unbeatable partnership  producing an astonishing 11 wins and two halves from 15 matches 	2	3	3
Well  certainly not on the American side  Mickelson told reporters when asked if the Americans had ever had two players so invested in each other 	2	1	1
The European side has had some great team mates with Seve and Ollie and some others but to be able to share this experience with Keegan and to partake in his great play and experience the Ryder Cup together has been really awesome 	3	4	1

Mickelson had the honors in the afternoon fourball landing a pinpoint tee shot at the 17th that ended the match with a handshake and world number one Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell conceding a 2&1 defeat 	1	3	2
Bradley and Mickelson then flexed their muscles in Saturday's foursomes with a record equaling 7&6 thrashing of Britons Lee Westwood and Donald to the thundering approval of the pro-American crowd 	2	3	1
Their margin of victory matched the wins earned by Hale Irwin and Tom Kite over Ken Brown and Des Smyth at the 1979 Ryder Cup  and by Paul Azinger and Mark O'Meara over Nick Faldo and David Gilford in 1991 	1	2	1
With the U S  up 8-4  captain Davis Love III decided to give his lead pair a rest from Saturday afternoon's fourball matches to have them fresh for Sunday's singles 	1	1	1

Brightest Star Explosion in History Reveals Lonely Supernova	3	2	2
The brightest exploding star ever seen with the naked eye in recorded history apparently experienced a quick and lonely death  a new study reveals 	3	2	2
The discovery  which centered on a star explosion witnessed in the year 1006  suggests that many similar outbursts leave no companion star to accompany their demise 	1	1	2
One type of star explosion  known as a Type 1a supernova  occurs when one star pours enough fuel onto a dying companion star known as a white dwarf to trigger an extraordinary nuclear explosion 	1	2	1
At its peak  researchers say the supernova  which exploded about 7 100 light-years away  was about one-quarter the brightness of the moon  luminous enough that people could have read by its light at midnight 	1	2	1
There are two ways Type 1a supernovas are born — the slow way  which involves a living star dumping gas onto a white dwarf  and the fast way  where two white dwarves merge catastrophically 	1	2	2
Whether slow origins of Type 1a supernovas were more commonplace than fast ones or vice versa remained a puzzle 	1	1	2
Knowing more about the causes behind these explosions is essential because Type 1a supernovas are key to gauging the rate at which the universe is expanding  which in turn could shed light on why this expansion is apparently accelerating due to a mysterious force called dark energy 	2	1	2
Scientists have tried looking for companion stars of Type 1a supernovas before 	1	1	1
One possible instance was Tycho's supernova  SN 1572  one of the few supernovas visible to the naked eye in historical records  although that case remains questioned 	3	1	2
"Using data from the Paranal Observatory in Chile  the researchers combed through the space 16 5 light-years in diameter around SN 1006 and ""do not find any star in the surroundings of the supernova remnant to be the possible companion of the progenitor of SN 1006 "" lead study author Jonay González Hernández  an astrophysicist at the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands in Spain  told SPACE com "	1	1	2
When combined with previous results  these findings suggest less than 20 percent of Type 1a supernovas apparently occur via the slow route 	1	1	1
The scientists detailed their findings in the Sept  27 issue of the journal Nature 	1	1	1
"Many Britney Spears fans were shocked by Thursday's ""Glee"" episode after the show gave the superstar's pop hits a second go -- this time dredging up Britney's past tribulations  including her 2007 head-shaving incident and umbrella attack on the paparazzi "	4	1	3
And it wasn't just Britney supporters who were angered 	3	1	2
"Speaking to Access Hollywood's Billy Bush on Friday  Britney's manager said the singer's team was completely unaware ""Glee"" was going to revisit Britney's troubled times and was ""livid"" over the episode "	3	1	2
"In addition to the one-scene ode to bald Britney  the inflammatory ep (dubbed ""Britney 2 0"") also recreated the pop princess' much-maligned ""Gimme More"" performance at the 2007 MTV VMAs  where the singer was criticized for everything ranging from less-than-six-pack abs  to poorly hidden hair extensions  to sloppy  low-energy dance moves "	4	1	3
"In the ""Glee"" episode  Brittany S  Pierce (played by Heather Morris) -- depressed over having to repeat her senior year of high school and missing her best friend/sometimes lover Santana -- was chosen to lead the Glee Club's pep assembly performance "	3	1	2
"Donning a costume similar to Britney's 2007 black two-piece ensemble  the show's Brittany meandered lazily through a half-hearted performance of ""Gimme More "" while lip-syncing and chowing down on a large bag of cheese puffs "	3	1	2
"Adding insult to injury  ""Britney 2 0"" aired directly after the superstar's new show  ""The X Factor"" on FOX "	3	1	2

BSkyB  Warner Bros sign UK film deal	1	1	1
LONDON (Reuters) - BSkyB has signed a deal for the right to screen new Warner Bros films on Sky Movies channels and video-on-demand services  tightening its grip on British pay-TV little more than a month after a regulator cleared it of unfairly dominating the British market 	2	1	2
Under the deal  announced on Wednesday and spanning five years  subscribers to Sky Movies and customers of NOW TV  an internet service powered by Sky  will have access to Warner releases about six months after they end their cinema runs 	1	1	1
The films  including blockbusters such as Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows and Batman sequel The Dark Knight Rises  will then be available exclusively on Sky Movies for more than a year 	1	1	1
The deal means that Sky continues to enjoy exclusive UK rights to new releases from all six major Hollywood studios 	1	1	1
Rivals complain that the satellite broadcaster's dominance of the British market restricts competition and leads to higher prices 	1	1	2
Last month the Competition Commission ruled that BSkyB's position in movies did not adversely affect Britain's pay-TV retail market  saying that new arrivals Lovefilm and Netflix had increased customer choice 	1	2	1
Some commentators are expecting Netflix to tryto sign up one of the big Hollywood studios to help it to build its business in Britain 	1	1	1
Buddhist statue found by Nazis made from meteorite	1	1	1
BERLIN (AP) — An ancient Buddhist statue that a Nazi expedition brought back from Tibet shortly before World War II was carved from a meteorite that crashed on Earth thousands of years ago 	1	1	1
What sounds like an Indiana Jones movie plot appears to have actually taken place  according to European researchers publishing in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science this month 	2	2	1
The Nazi-backed venture set out for Tibet in 1938 in part to trace the origins of the Aryan race — a cornerstone of the Nazis' racist ideology 	1	1	2
"The existence of the 10 6-kilogram (23 4-pound) statue  known as ""iron man "" was only revealed in 2007 when its owner died and it came up for auction  Buchner told The Associated Press "	2	1	2
German and Austrian scientists were able to get permission from its new owner  who wasn't disclosed  to conduct a chemical analysis that shows the statue came from the Chinga meteorite  which crashed in the area of what is now the Russian and Mongolian border around 15 000 years ago 	1	2	1
The swastika has been used by various cultures throughout the ages  but the Nazis tried to appropriate it as the symbol of their ideology  going so far as to put a right-facing version of it on their red and white flag 	2	1	2
Scientists not involved in the study told the AP that the research linking the statue to the meteorite was credible 	1	2	1
Looks like a solid piece of geochemical 'forensic' work  said Qing-Zhu Yin  a researcher in geology at the University of California  Davis 	2	2	1
"No terrestrial artifact would generally contain that much nickel content	1	2	1
108 buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280 Chemical elements don't lie "	2	1	1
Rhian Jones  an associate professor at the University of New Mexico who specializes in meteorites  said the claim appeared conclusive 	2	2	1
"I am not a historian	1	1	2
108 buddhist-statue-found-nazis-made-meteorite-213623280 But the 'iron man' does not look like a Buddha to me from my cultural background  he said "	2	1	2
"It looks more like a warrior with a sword     (a) resemblance of Genghis Khan	1	1	1

Business groups protest Calif  carbon market	1	1	2
SACRAMENTO  Calif 	1	1	1
"(AP) — Dozens of people  some wearing red ""Save Our Jobs"" T-shirts  packed a public meeting on Thursday to testify that a key component of California's landmark greenhouse gas emissions law will impose enormous costs on them and consumers "	3	1	3
The program's fees amount to a $1 billion-a-year tax increase at a time when the state's economy is sputtering  they said 	3	1	3
The California Chamber of Commerce and others wrote Gov  Jerry Brown urging him to halt the start of the program  which begins in earnest on Nov  14 and is the central element of California's 2006 climate-change law  AB32 	3	1	3
A key issue for those opposed to the program is costs associated with the permits — called allowances — which the program will require businesses to buy  some at auction 	3	1	3
In general  cap-and-trade will place a limit  or cap  of the emissions of heat-trapping gases that are allowed from pollution producers like refineries and cement manufacturers 	2	2	1
The businesses will be required to buy these allowances from the state  with each permit allowing for a specified amount of greenhouse gases each year 	1	1	1
For the first two years of the program  businesses will receive 90 percent of their allowances for free  with the free amount and the cap declining over time 	1	1	1
The chamber and other businesses want the amount of free allowances increased to reduce the impact on their businesses in a struggling economy 	2	1	3
The fact is that this auction represents a multi-billion dollar hidden tax that will harm California businesses and consumers by dramatically increasing energy costs at a time we can least afford it  the letter to the governor stated 	3	1	4
Business groups say the uncertainty about what costs associated with cap-and-trade will be in 2015 — when the number of free allowances are set to be reduced — are influencing investment decisions being made now 	3	1	3
They want assurance that those costs will be lowered by offering more free allowances 	3	2	3
We need to send the message now     that more allowances will be available to industry  said Dorothy Rothrock of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association 	3	2	2
2015 is right around the corner and manufacturers are making plans this year for the next three-to-five years and capital investments may or may not happen in California based on the current regulations 	3	1	2
The board has designed the system to financially reward businesses that reduce emissions below their cap — meaning money could be made through cap and trade 	2	2	1
Polluters that reduce emissions could turn a profit if the market price for extra allowances rises above the initial cost of the permit 	2	2	2
This system rewards those that are more efficient and allows those who can't or don't want to reduce their emissions too keep on operating and pass the cost of allowances on to their customers  Mary Nichols  the board's chairman  said 	3	3	1
"A company can also meet up to 8 percent of its emissions reduction obligations by purchasing carbon ""offsets "" or investments in forestry or other projects that reduce greenhouse gases "	2	2	1
The program  the largest in the U S   is modeled on similar programs in Europe  and designed to be able to link up with plans in other states and elsewhere to increase the size of its market for carbon allowance trading 	2	2	1
(The board) has gone a long way to make these regulations as simple and palatable as possible  Nichols said 	3	3	1
At this point it's time for CMTA and WSPA and the chamber to join the many of hundreds of businesses that are investing in the fight against climate change instead of fighting AB32 	3	2	1
Cabrera homer helps Tigers close on White Sox	1	2	1
(Reuters) - Miguel Cabrera continued his bid for baseball's rare triple crown and helped the Detroit Tigers close the gap on the Chicago White Sox in the American League Central with a 6-2 victory over Oakland on Wednesday 	2	3	1
Ace pitcher Justin Verlander tossed six scoreless innings to make it an easy night at home for the Tigers (79-69) as they pulled within two games of first place Chicago (81-67)  who lost 3-0 at Kansas City 	2	3	2
Cabrera's bid to become the first man to lead the league in batting  home runs and RBIs since Boston's Carl Yastrzemski in 1967 is becoming a gripping subplot to the league-wide race for the playoffs 	2	2	1
The Venezuelan infielder  already pacing the AL in hitting ( 333) and RBIs (130)  blasted his 41st home run to put him one behind leader Josh Hamilton of the Texas Rangers with just 14 games remaining 	2	2	1
"It's amazing  Cabrera told reporters  ""I feel very good right now  I'm trying to see my pitches and go out there and battle  (But) we have to focus on winning games right now """	3	4	1
The win helped the Dodgers (77-72) stay just two games out of the second Wild Card spot held by St  Louis (79-70) 	1	2	1
Despite the defeat in the second game  Washington (90-58) hold a five-game lead in the NL East over Atlanta  moving closer to their first playoff berth since the franchise moved to the capital in 2005 	1	2	2
Calculate Your 2013 Facebook Ad Spend With This Free Tool	1	2	1
Aiming to take some of the mystery out of calculating ad spending on Facebook  social media marketing firm Syncapse has introduced a free online tool that lets brand managers do the math 	2	2	1
The tool  which went live Thursday morning  takes into account multiple variables that would affect such spending  including target market  market conditions and interests 	1	1	1
In a hypothetical example with a very broad target  Syncapse's calculator recommended that Kraft Foods' Oreo brand spend $27 6 million communicating with existing fans next year and $103 million going after friends of fans  Here's how it got to that number:	1	1	1
First  the calculator asks for the size of your target market  You can also specify interests  Facebook has a database of 8 million or so such interests  which can range from celebrities (Martha Stewart) to sports (mountain biking) to TV shows (The Walking Dead ) In this case  no interest was specified:	1	1	1
"Scissons acknowledges that the online tool provides a ballpark estimate of spending and that various factors  including Facebook's steady stream of new advertising products  can't be anticipated  However  Scissons says his firm created the tool to illustrate that Facebook is more a platform for CRM than traditional marketing  ""There are a lot of agencies on the market that are trying to buy cheap fans "" Scissons says  ""We're trying to educate the market that they should be thinking of reach and frequency """	1	1	2
"In the near future  Scissons believes  marketers will begin to think of ""frequency"" as the new advertising and will bank more on exposure via social media than would-be viral campaigns as a driver of purchases  For example  a woman who is interested in Coach handbags may be a Facebook fan  but she may not be interested in ""engaging"" with the brand on Facebook very much  However  if she's exposed to the right amount of messaging at the right frequency  eventually the brand will reach her when she's in the market for a handbag "	1	2	1

California man behind anti-Islam film arrested	1	1	2
Nakoula Basseley Nakoula  55  was convicted in 2010 for federal check and sentenced to 21 months in prison  Under terms of his probation  he was not allowed to use computers or the Internet for five years without approval from his probation officer 	1	1	2
Nakoula was arrested after federal probation officials determined he violated the terms of his supervised release  said Thomas Mrozek U S  Attorney's spokesman in Los Angeles 	1	1	2
A U S  District Court hearing was scheduled for Nakoula on Thursday afternoon  It was closed to media and the public 	1	1	1
"Protests have erupted around the Middle East over a 14-minute trailer for ""Innocence of Muslims "" which depicts Muhammad as a womanizer  religious fraud and child molester  Though the trailer was posted to YouTube in July  the violence didn't break out until Sept  11 and has spread since  killing dozens "	1	1	3
Nakoula  a Christian originally from Egypt  went into hiding after he was identified as the man behind the trailer 	1	1	2
The next day  the AP determined there was no Bacile and linked the identity to Nakoula  a former gas station owner with a drug conviction and a history of using aliases  Federal authorities later confirmed there was no Bacile and that Nakoula was behind the movie 	1	1	2
Before going into hiding  Nakoula acknowledged to the AP he was involved with the film  but said he only worked on logistics and management 	1	1	2
A film permit listed Media for Christ  a Los Angeles-area charity run by other Egyptian Christians  as the production company  Most of the film was made at the charity's headquarters  Steve Klein  an insurance agent in Hemet and outspoken Muslim critic  has said he was a consultant and promoter for the film 	1	2	1
The trailer still can be found on YouTube  The Obama administration asked Google  YouTube's parent  to take down the video but the company has refused  saying it did not violate its content standards 	1	1	2
"Meantime  a number of actors and workers on the film have come forward to say they were duped  They say they were hired for a film titled ""Desert Warrior"" and there was no mention of Islam or Muhammad in the script  Those references were dubbed in after filming was completed "	1	1	2
Actress Cindy Lee Garcia has sued to get the trailer taken down  saying she was duped 	1	1	2
"Cameron backs minister in row over ""pleb"" swipe at police"	1	2	2
"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's David Cameron backed a senior minister accused of ranting at policemen in public and calling them ""plebs""  an old-fashioned insult laden with snobbery that has undermined his party's attempts to shake off its privileged image "	1	2	2
The tirade outside the prime minister's Downing Street office by Andrew Mitchell has embarrassed a Conservative party that is trailing in the polls and struggling to shore up its support at a time of recession  tax increases and spending cuts 	1	1	2
"While reports that Mitchell called the officers ""morons"" were embarrassing  more damaging was the report that he used the word ""pleb""  a term that is rarely used by a middle or working class person but is soaked in upper class condescension "	1	1	2
The row played into the hands of Conservative critics who think Cameron's centre-right party is run by a rich  lofty group whose policies do little for the majority of voters feeling the pressure of its austerity policies 	1	1	2
"Rivals mock them as out-of-touch ""toffs""  the sort of derogatory term that is politically toxic in class-obsessed Britain  A Conservative politician described Cameron and chancellor George Osborne as ""arrogant posh boys"" in April "	1	1	2
Cameron's spokesman said on Monday it was time to draw a line under the affair after Mitchell apologised again to police  even while denying using the words attributed to him 	1	2	2
He has acknowledged that that behaviour was unacceptable and the apology has been accepted  the spokesman said  He would not be drawn on Mitchell's choice of words or whether he was accusing the police of not telling the truth 	1	2	2
Pleb is derived from a Latin word denoting people outside the aristocratic class in ancient Rome  for example shopkeepers  skilled or unskilled workers and farmers 	1	1	1
"It is old-fashioned language  it is private language  In public it is pretty awful  Peter York  the author and social commentator  told Reuters  ""You certainly wouldn't expect any politician to utter it in a remotely public place """	2	1	2
A leaked police report in the top selling Sun newspaper on Monday said Mitchell had lost his temper when police officers refused to open the main Downing Street gates to allow him to cycle through last Wednesday evening 	1	1	2
"When they asked him to use a pedestrian gate  the report said Mitchell erupted: ""Best you learn your fucking place  You don't run this fucking government  You're fucking plebs """	1	1	2
The timing could not have been worse  coming a day after two unarmed policewomen were killed in a gun and grenade attack in Manchester  northern England 	2	1	3
"They have been remarkably unsuccessful at killing this story  said John Curtice  politics professor at Strathclyde University in Scotland  ""That's certainly a problem """	2	1	2
"Mitchell went on to Cambridge University and served in the British Army before joining the Lazard investment bank and working for a management consultancy  Cameron gave him the job of ""chief whip""  or party enforcer  earlier this month "	1	1	1
"Mitchell said he ""did not use the words that have been attributed to me""  but repeatedly refused to confirm what he did say during an incident dubbed ""Gate-gate"" by wags on Twitter "	1	1	2
"It had been the end of a long and extremely frustrating day - not that that is any excuse at all for what happened  Mitchell told reporters in the rain outside his office near Downing Street  ""I didn't show the police the amount of respect I should have done """	1	1	2
There is this perception that     they are posh  rich people who are out of touch with the lives of ordinary people  said Wyn Grant  politics professor at Warwick University 	1	1	2
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate in August officially slipped to 1 2 percent from 1 3 percent in July  but there was in fact little difference between the two months  Statistics Canada said on Friday 	1	1	1
Statscan analysts said the more precise August figure was 1 24 percent and had been rounded down to 1 2 percent 	1	1	1
Market analysts had expected a 1 3 percent year-on-year increase in August 	2	1	1
Energy prices rose 0 8 percent following three consecutive months of year-over-year declines 	1	1	1

Canada says unclear whether it will pursue China trade talks	1	1	2
At this point in time it would be premature to speculate on whether Canada will move forward with any type of trade negotiation with China  Trade Minister Ed Fast told reporters in a news conference 	1	1	2
The only thing I can say is we are committed to deepening our trade and investment relationship with China going forward  he said 	1	2	1
Foreign Minister John Baird said last week that Canada should focus on finishing up trade deals that are already underway  leading some to suspect trade talks with China had been taken off the table 	1	1	2

Capsule reviews of 'Dredd 3D ' other new releases	1	1	1
"Dredd 3D — A wickedly dark comic streak breaks up the vivid violence and relentless bleakness of this 3-D incarnation of the cult-favorite British comic series ""2000 A D "" The visceral visuals  shot in 3-D by Oscar-winning ""Slumdog Millionaire"" cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle  feature extreme close-ups and sequences of super-cool slow-motion photography  which wisely are spread sparingly throughout the course of the picture "	2	3	1
Karl Urban stars as the stoic Judge Dredd  the baddest bad-ass of them all in a dystopian future where enforcers like him serve as judge  jury and executioner 	2	3	2
Dredd is the most fearsome of the judges in the squalid  densely populated Mega City One  with his ever-present helmet and a low  monotone grumble that recalls both Christian Bale's Batman and Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name 	3	3	2
(For the uninitiated  Dredd is actually much funnier than this description makes him sound  his terse  deadpan responses to the most absurd and depraved situations provoke the biggest laughs )	3	2	2
Olivia Thirlby has a calm yet confident presence as the rookie Judge Anderson  who happens to have been assigned to Dredd for training upon one particularly bloody day 	3	2	2
Her psychic abilities make her an asset when things get especially chaotic  and her slightly ethereal nature provides a nice complement to Dredd's intense groundedness 	2	3	2
Dredd and Anderson respond to a triple homicide at the Peach Trees housing complex  a 200-story ghetto ruled by the ruthless prostitute-turned-drug-lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) 	2	2	3

"You've also seen the found-footage movie a million times before  beginning with the precedent-setting ""Blair Witch Project"" in 1999 and again in recent years following the success of the low-budget 2007 horror film ""Paranormal Activity """	2	1	2
But admittedly  the found-footage aesthetic infuses the film with both intimacy and vibrancy  it creates the illusion that what we're watching is unscripted  and so we feel like we don't know what's going to happen from one moment to the next 	3	3	1
And co-stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena have such tremendous chemistry with each other  they make you want to ride alongside them all day  despite the many perils in store 	3	3	1
As they insistently goof on each other in often hilarious fashion  their banter reveals not just an obvious and believable brotherly bond but also the kind of gallows humor necessary to make the horrors of their profession tolerable 	2	3	3

The Perks of Being a Wallflower — This coming-of-age story  based on the best-selling young adult novel of the same name  features a well-chosen cast  an eclectic music mix and some moments of uncomfortable honesty as well as dreamlike wonder 	3	3	1
It's anchored by strong performances on two ends of the acting spectrum: from Logan Lerman as Charlie  the high-school freshman of the film's title whose reserved nature can't hide his obvious intelligence and sweetness  and from Ezra Miller in a showy turn as Patrick  the quick-witted and gay senior-class clown who takes Patrick under his wing 	2	3	1
"Directed and written by ""Perks"" novelist Stephen Chbosky  the film follows these characters and their friends over a school year and all its rituals: football games  holidays  awkward dances and late-night gabfests at the local diner in their typical Pittsburgh suburb "	2	2	1
"Yes  it feels like formula  right down to rebellious thrill of experimenting with drugs and alcohol and the liberation of experiencing ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show """	3	3	2
But there's also a darkness that follows Charlie  even at his happiest  which keeps this movie from turning completely safe and self-satisfied 	3	2	1

Cardiac arrests at school usually not in students	1	1	1
In a new five-year study  researchers from Michigan found that only two out of 47 cardiac arrests at K-12 schools occurred during sports events 	1	1	2
In fact  as many as a third of cases happened after 5 pm and mostly in adults 	1	1	1
His findings  based on registries and interviews with bystanders and school officials across the country  show that fewer than two out of every 1 000 cardiac arrests overall happen at K-12 schools 	1	1	2
"Still  Swor told Reuters Health  ""these are high-profile events individually "	2	1	1
After looking at how often cardiac arrests happen in schools  and who are the most frequent victims  Swor and his colleagues conclude more attention to emergency response capabilities and preparedness in schools is needed 	1	1	1
If the heart is beating too fast - known as ventricular tachycardia - to pump out enough blood  or just quivering chaotically in so-called ventricular fibrillation  the AED can jolt it back to its normal rhythm 	1	1	1
Just last week  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed legislation making AEDs and cardiac emergency plans a requirement at all schools in the state 	1	1	1
Swor's team  whose results were published in the journal Resuscitation  was able to interview people at 30 of the 47 schools they located 	1	1	1
It turned out that 19 had AEDs 	1	1	1
When the AED had been used  four out of 11 people survived until they were discharged from the hospital 	1	2	1
When the device hadn't been used  the survival rate was two out of eight 	1	1	2
It confirms that if you put the AED on you are in good shape  because we are talking about a 50-percent survival  said Dr  Myron Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University  who has studied AEDs but was not involved in the new work 	1	2	1
About 300 000 Americans suffer cardiac arrest every year and fewer than eight in 100 leave the hospital alive 	1	1	3
AEDs  which are placed in airports and many other public areas  may save nearly 500 lives every year  according to a study by Weisfeldt and colleagues from 2010 	1	2	1
The devices can be bought for less than $2 000 and are easy for laypeople to use 	1	1	1
When in doubt  he added  the AED should always be used because it won't deliver any shocks unless it detects a specific heart rhythm disturbance 	1	1	1
Both Swor and Weisfeldt called for drills in schools to teach staff and students the signs of cardiac arrest  as well as how to give chest compressions and use an AED - and of course  call 911 	2	1	1
We have fire drills  we have tornado drills  said Swor 	2	1	1
It's a teachable moment  he said 	2	1	1
Cardinals beat up Eagles 27-6	1	1	1
(AP) — Kevin Kolb got the best of his former team 	1	2	1
Michael Vick might be wishing he was still in Philadelphia the way the Arizona Cardinals battered him around 	3	1	2
Kolb threw for 222 yards and two touchdowns  James Sanders returned one of Vick's two first-half fumbles 93 yards for a touchdown and the Cardinals ran over the Eagles 27-6 on Sunday for their best start in 38 years 	1	2	1
Kolb was sharp  hitting 17 of 24 passes  and Arizona (3-0) sacked Vick five times for its best start since 1974  more than a dozen years before the team moved to the desert 	2	2	1
Philadelphia (2-1) became the first NFL team to open a season with two one-point wins 	1	2	1
The Eagles didn't give themselves a chance to rally for another victory  picked apart by the quarterback they cast away and hounded by Arizona's attacking defense 	3	1	1
The NFL's best offense the first two games  the Eagles had three turnovers  running their season total to 12  and labored all day against the scrappy Cardinals 	3	1	1
After three years of waiting behind Donovan McNabb  Kolb was pushed aside when Vick made his triumphant return to the NFL 	3	2	1
Even after being traded to Arizona and landing a huge contract extension  Kolb still had to fight for recognition 	2	1	1
He lost a tight preseason battle with Skelton  but came off the bench in the opener against Seattle when Skelton sprained his right ankle 	1	1	2
Kolb took the Cardinals on the winning drive and was steady enough last week to lead them to one of their biggest road victories in recent years  20-18 over the New England Patriots 	2	3	1
Skelton returned to practice late this week  but was limited and ended up watching Sunday's game in street clothes 	1	1	1
Kolb  who missed last year's win over the Eagles with a foot injury  made the most of his opportunity  carving up Philadelphia's secondary with crisp passes 	2	2	1
He completed all three of his throws on Arizona's opening drive to set up Jay Feely's 16th straight field goal  from 47 yards 	1	2	1
After the Cardinals recovered a fumble by Eagles punt returner Damaris Johnson  Kolb threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Michael Floyd  who made his first NFL catch a memorable one by juggling the ball through two Philadelphia defenders 	1	1	1
Kolb kept clicking in the second quarter  throwing a 37-yard touchdown pass to Fitzgerald that put the Cardinals up 17-0 	1	2	1
Arizona's offense bogged down in the second half — 28 yards in the third quarter — but ground the game away with a time-consuming  13-play drive in the fourth quarter that resulted in a 27-yard field goal by Feely for a 27-6 lead 	2	1	1
Vick  on the other hand  spent most of his day being chased or knocked down 	3	1	2
The Cardinals hit him hard twice on Philadelphia's first series and linebacker Sam Acho caused him to fumble with a hit early in the second quarter to end a drive into Arizona's end of the field 	3	1	2
Vick finally got the Eagles going late in the first half  only to have it end in disaster 	2	2	3
Forced to throw it away on two plays from Arizona's 1-yard line  he was blindsided by Kerry Rhodes on third down and fumbled 	1	1	2
Sanders scooped it up and raced up the sideline  picking up a couple of blockers along the way to a 93-yard fumble return for a touchdown that put Arizona up 24-0 at halftime 	2	2	1
The Eagles put up some yards in the second half  just not many points 	3	1	1
Philadelphia opened the third quarter with two solid drives  but settled for a pair of field goals by Alex Henery and never threatened Arizona's lead 	2	1	1
He reached the milestone in 29 years and 23 days  eclipsing Dallas tight end Jason Witten  who hit the mark last week at 30 years and 133 days 	1	1	1

Chavez  challenger aim for youth  women voters	1	1	1
CARACAS  Venezuela (AP) — Presidential candidate Henrique Capriles is mobbed at rallies by ecstatic women who press close to touch him and leave scratches on his arms and neck 	1	1	3
"Some shout ""Marry me!"" to the single 40-year-old who's trying to unseat President Hugo Chavez in next month's hotly contested vote "	1	1	2
The 58-year-old Chavez campaigns as the living legend who for more than 13 years has remade this oil-rich country in his socialistic vision 	1	2	1
But he's also adjusting his approach as he confronts for the first time a younger  charismatic rival 	1	1	2
The two are taking at times contrasting approaches ahead of Venezuela's Oct  7 election but they're aiming for the same pool of swing voters made up of Venezuelans under 30 and women of all social classes 	1	1	1
While recent polls show everything from a tie to a double-digit lead for Chavez  they've also revealed between 10 and 20 percent of voters who are either undecided or won't say whom they support 	1	2	2
"To try to persuade them  Chavez and his campaign have been using ""the threat that Henrique Capriles has a package of secret economic measures that are going to seriously affect them "" Alvarez said "	1	1	2
As for Capriles' side  I'd say the strategy is to show that Chavez's government has performed badly in a range of areas from crime to jobs  Alvarez said 	1	1	2
"Who will win?	1	1	1
121 chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953 The one that manages to convince those voters    that his adversary is the more dangerous one "	1	1	2
The opposition-aligned organization Voto Joven  or Youth Vote  estimates that more than a third of registered voters are between the ages of 18 and 25  making them a key target for both camps 	1	2	1
As the response at campaign events show  Capriles' appeal to women has become another asset  turning the lean  athletic candidate into a kind of opposition sex symbol 	3	1	2
On the stump  Capriles has argued that he would inject a fresh voice into politics and replace a bloated administration that's run out of ideas 	1	2	1
He also tries to reassure Venezuelans that he won't take away the social programs started by Chavez and will manage a peaceful transition of power 	1	3	1
I ask each Venezuelan to reflect deeply  put your hand on your heart and think if it can be better  and think if after 14 years  whether the one who didn't come through is going to do it in the next six years  Capriles told supporters at a rally on Monday 	1	2	1
Think about it  young people  women 	1	1	1
First  Chavez has tried to erase doubts about his health after more than a year of cancer treatment 	1	2	2
He's shown up on television singing and dancing  even at times slinging an electric bass guitar over his shoulder and pretending to play to the beat 	2	3	1
Nonetheless  he's appeared at fewer rallies and has at times looked noticeably bloated and aged 	3	1	2
He's also gone to great lengths to freshen up his image for younger voters 	3	2	1
Instead of his military fatigues  he's been wearing casual blue jackets and occasionally a yellow scarf 	2	1	1
Who's the candidate of the future? the president shouted to thousands of supporters during a speech outside Caracas 	1	1	1
Chavez!	1	1	1
"Singing with a band  the president then belted out the lyrics to his campaign jingle: ""Chavez  heart of the people!"""	2	3	1
On the streets of Caracas  young supporters have painted cartoon-like murals depicting Chavez as a rapper with tattoos  a basketball player and a motorcycle-taxi driver — images apparently geared at making him seem cool to voters who've grown up during his presidency 	3	2	1
Jacqueline Faria  a leading Chavez campaign official  said the murals simply reflect the love Chavez enjoys from Venezuela's youth 	1	2	1
The president has youth  youth exuding from every pore  she said 	1	2	1
"The president has also wielded a tougher message  telling voters in speeches that he stands for stability while his opponent represents ""chaos"" and would do away with the government's popular social programs "	1	2	2
With our great victory  we are going to continue leaving behind the horror 	1	2	1
"Chavez has also unleashed scathing rhetoric to paint Capriles as a protector of the wealthy ""bourgeoisie "" calling his ilk ""fascists"" and ""neo-Nazis """	1	1	3
Last week  Capriles was forced to boot a top aide from his campaign after the lawmaker was caught on video accepting a purported bribe 	2	1	2
Violence has also broken out at campaign events  including a rock-throwing clash before a Capriles rally last week in which police said at least 14 people were hurt 	2	1	3
However  he has accused Chavez of lying about the government's achievements and neglecting the country's oil industry  infrastructure and agriculture 	1	1	3
They're importing everything: rice  coffee  beef  milk  Capriles said in a speech this week 	1	1	1
"He also pointed to dramatically higher murder rates and said that in this vote  ""We're going to make a life-and-death decision """	1	1	2
"With Capriles focusing on such concrete issues  Chavez ""has no choice but to be doubly aggressive "" said Alfredo Keller  a Venezuelan pollster and political consultant who says he isn't working for either side "	2	1	3
Trying to hone their strategies  both candidates have reportedly turned to experienced campaign consultants for advice 	2	2	1
Venezuelans newspapers have reported that Chavez hired Brazilian consultant Joao Santana  who ran the campaigns of Brazilian presidents Dilma Rousseff and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva 	1	1	1
"Faria said she was unable to confirm the reports and that others in charge of the campaign ""have sought out his advisers """	1	1	1
Judging from the frenzy at Capriles rallies  the approach is working  especially among his women fans 	2	2	1
He's our president  Delgado said  on the verge of tears 	1	2	1
"Look at me	1	1	1
121 chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953 I'm overcome with emotion "	1	2	1
"Chavez has responded by trying to tie Capriles to the past  recently asking at a campaign rally  ""Who's the candidate of the coup plotters of April?"" referring to the 2002 putsch that briefly ousted Chavez "	2	1	2
"Who's the candidate of the homeland?"""	1	2	1
This year  the president has had to campaign against that very image of himself 	1	1	1
To win there has to be a deep emotional connection  Capriles said in an interview on his campaign bus 	1	1	1
"I think the government's candidate has worn out his	1	1	2
121 chavez-challenger-aim-youth-women-voters-183032953 He doesn't project that energy  that spark "	1	1	2

Chef found guilty of murder in boiled body case	1	1	4
In a recorded interrogation presented by prosecutors during the trial  David Viens  49  can be heard saying he cooked the body of his 39-year-old wife  Dawn  in late 2009 until little was left but her skull 	2	1	5
Authorities say he jumped after learning he was a suspect in her disappearance	1	1	3
The trial relied heavily on recorded interviews with authorities in which the chef acknowledged the crime in detail 	2	1	2
I just slowly cooked it and I ended up cooking her for four days  Viens could be heard saying on the recording 	4	1	5
He said he mixed what remained after four days with other waste  dumping some of it in a grease pit at his restaurant in Lomita  and putting the rest in the trash 	1	1	3
But a search of the house turned up nothing  nor did an excavation of the restaurant 	1	1	1
On the recording played in court  Viens was asked what happened on Oct  18  2009  the night his wife disappeared 	1	1	1
He said he had noticed money missing from his restaurant and suspected his wife 	1	1	2
They got into an argument  he said  and he forced her onto the floor where he wrapped her up and put a piece of duct tape over her mouth before going to bed 	1	1	4
He awoke to find her dead and panicked  he said 	2	1	4
Viens had pleaded not guilty 	1	1	1
Chemist in Mass  lab scandal could see new charges	2	1	2
BOSTON (AP) — A chemist accused of lying about drug samples she tested at a state lab could face additional charges as prosecutors and defense attorneys sift through thousands of criminal cases that could be upended by her actions 	1	1	2
Many more defendants are expected to be released 	1	1	1
Annie Dookhan's alleged actions corrupted the integrity of the entire criminal justice system  state Attorney General Martha Coakley said during a news conference after Dookhan's arrest 	2	1	2
There are many victims as a result of this 	2	1	3
Dookhan faces more than 20 years in prison on charges of obstruction of justice and falsely pretending to hold a degree from a college or university 	1	1	3
She testified under oath that she holds a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts  but school officials say they have no record of her receiving an advanced degree or taking graduate courses there 	1	1	2
State police say Dookhan tested more than 60 000 drug samples involving 34 000 defendants during her nine years at the Hinton State Laboratory Institute in Boston 	1	1	1
Defense lawyers and prosecutors are scrambling to figure out how to deal with the fallout 	2	1	1
"Assistant Attorney General John Verner called the charges against Dookhan ""preliminary"" and said a ""much broader"" investigation is being conducted "	2	1	1
Verner said Dookhan later acknowledged to state police that she sometimes would take 15 to 25 samples and instead of testing them all  she would test only five of them  then list them all as positive 	1	1	1
She said that sometimes  if a sample tested negative  she would take known cocaine from another sample and add it to the negative sample to make it test positive for cocaine  Verner said 	2	1	1
Dookhan pleaded not guilty and was later released on $10 000 bail 	1	1	1
She was ordered to turn over her passport  submit to GPS monitoring  and not have contact with any former or current employees of the lab 	1	1	1
Dookhan's relatives and attorney declined to comment after the brief hearing in Boston Municipal Court 	1	1	1
In one of the cases  Boston police had tested a substance as negative for cocaine  but when Dookhan tested it  she reported it as positive 	1	1	1
Investigators later retested the cample and it came back negative  Verner said 	1	1	1
The only motive authorities have found so far is that Dookhan wanted to be seen as a good worker  Coakley said 	1	1	1
According to a state police report in August  Dookhan said she just wanted to get the work done and never meant to hurt anyone 	1	2	1
I screwed up big-time  she is quoted as saying 	3	1	2
"I messed up bad  it's my fault	3	1	2
124 chemist-mass-lab-scandal-could-see-charges-065818281 I don't want the lab to get in trouble "	3	1	2
However  Coakley said  there is no indication so far of criminal activity by anyone else at the lab 	2	2	1
Co-workers began expressing concern about Dookhan's work habits several years ago  but her supervisors allowed her to continue working 	1	2	2
One co-worker told state police he never saw Dookhan in front of a microscope 	2	1	1
In an interview with state police late last month  Dookhan acknowledged faking test results for two to three years 	1	1	2
She also said she forged the initials of colleagues and deliberately turned a negative sample into a positive for narcotics a few times 	1	1	1
I hope the system isn't treating the evidence against her the way she treated the evidence against several thousand defendants  said defense attorney John T  Martin  who has a client who was allowed to withdraw his guilty plea based on concerns over Dookhan's work 	2	2	2
Dookhan was suspended from lab duties after getting caught forging a colleague's initials on paperwork in June 2011 	1	1	2
She resigned in March as the Department of Public Health investigated 	1	1	1
The lab was run by the department until July 1  when state police took over as part of a state budget directive 	1	1	1
Chevron says Richmond repair time unknown	1	1	1
"The 245 000 barrels-per-day plant  which accounts for one-eighth of California's refining capacity  has run at a ""reduced"" rate since the fire  and this has risen only marginally since then  General Manager Nigel Hearne said in an interview "	2	1	1
The lower throughput caused a jump in gasoline prices in California as traders scrambled to find alternative supplies 	2	1	1
The crude unit shutdown has left California  which consumes more gasoline than any other U S  state  vulnerable to price spikes when any of the state's 15 refineries have problems 	1	1	2
The cause of the fire is also of great concern for the people living near the refinery 	2	1	3
While investigations are still under way  the focus has centered on a failed pipe component less than 5 feet long 	1	1	1
More than 200 residents gathered in a Richmond auditorium on Monday night to ask questions of the various regulatory bodies investigating the fire 	1	1	1
"Chemical Safety Board investigator Steve Cutchen said sections of the wall of the pipe had thinned to 20 percent of its design  and called the accident a ""close call"" that ""could have been far worse """	3	1	1
Chevron said this pipe had a low-silicon content  making it more susceptible to corrosion  which was understood by its technical staff but not acted upon 	2	1	1
Chevron found that  in a scheduled maintenance in November 2011  the 200 feet of piping in question had been inspected in 19 different locations  but not the component that failed 	1	1	1
"Asked how long the plant would be down  Hearne said assessments of the damage would need to be completed in the ""next few weeks"" to establish the timeline for repairs "	1	1	1
"We're still in the process of fully inspecting the plant  he said  including every individual component in carbon steel systems exposed to the same ""high-temperature sulfidation corrosion"" that it believes affected the pipe "	2	1	1
Full access to the refinery had just been opened up by investigators 	1	1	1
Analysts had expected repairs to the refinery's crude distillation unit  known as Crude Unit No  4  to take between 3 months and 6 months 	1	1	1
The hydrocarbons being processed at the plant were being provided by both the market and Chevron's other U S  refineries  he added 	1	1	1
The Richmond refinery  Chevron's oldest  opened 110 years ago 	1	1	1
On Sunday  the San Francisco Chronicle reported the plant was being investigated by the U S  Environmental Protection Agency over a 3-inch (7 6-centimeter) pipe that let emissions bypass pollution control equipment 	1	1	1
Hearne said the pipe was not a deliberate design  and had been in place before the implementation of monitoring of flaring at the refinery 	1	1	1
Will Chick-fil-A face a backlash for not opposing gay marriage?	1	1	1
This time  however  the tables are turned 	2	1	1
A Chicago alderman  Joe Moreno  announced that he was dropping his opposition to the fried-chicken purveyor's plans to build a new restaurant on his turf  after the company sent him a letter essentially promising to stop donating money to groups who actively oppose same-sex marriage 	2	2	2
"Gay rights activists  who had been boycotting Chick-fil-A since CEO Dan Cathy said he believed in the ""biblical definition"" of marriage  cheered "	1	1	2
Gay-marriage opponents  however  are furious 	2	1	3
Is the chicken chain going to face another boycott over its social policies?	2	1	2
This backlash will be worse than the first: Chick-fil-A faced a firestorm for opposing gay marriage  says Doug Stanglin at USA Today  but that was nothing compared to the fury it's facing now from gay-marriage opponents 	2	1	3
"They had flocked to the restaurant in solidarity  and now they're crushed that the company has apparently ""caved """	2	1	2
"As one commenter on Chick-fil-A's Facebook page put it  the company now has ""a whole new group of people who will no longer support"" it "	2	1	2
Chick-fil-A's 'cave' stirs new backlash	3	1	2
"Maybe liberal businesses should brace themselves: I understand why Chick-fil-A would want to ""forfeit their status as a national political lightning rod "" says Allahpundit at Hot Air "	2	1	2
"Still  it's ""depressing to see them cave"" — and I support gay marriage "	3	2	2
"Letting liberal politicians ""bully"" you into withholding money from your favorite political causes ""sets a terrible precedent """	2	1	2
"Maybe now red-staters will withhold zoning permits from liberal business-owners until they take ""a solemn vow not to give money to the Left anymore """"Chicago"	3	1	2
"alderman: Chick-fil-A promised me in writing they’ll stop giving to anti-gay-marriage groups"""	2	1	2
Relax 	3	1	1
"Why should the people who flocked to Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day be upset about that?""Will you boldly proclaim?"""	2	1	1
China seals Bo's fate ahead of November 8 leadership congress	2	1	2
With the Communist Party congress about six weeks away  further steps in the case could come before then  helping pave the way for a transition of power  experts said 	2	2	1
Bo Xilai's actions created grave repercussions and did massive harm to the reputation of the party and state  producing an extremely malign effect at home and abroad  the official statement from a party leaders' meeting said  according to a report by the official Xinhua news agency 	2	1	3
"The official statement carried by Xinhua said that in the murder scandal  Bo ""abused his powers of office  committed serious errors and bears a major responsibility"" "	2	1	3
"Reports that Bo  the ""princeling"" son of a revolutionary leader  could escape with a light punishment have now been dealt a fatal blow  and accusations of womanizing could further tarnish his reputation in the eyes of Chinese people "	2	1	2
I think it's quite certain that he won't be able to escape punishment under the criminal law  but the timing makes it unlikely that will happen before the congress  said He 	3	1	2
"I'd guess that he'll get a jail sentence of 20 years or longer	3	1	2
127 china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117 The death penalty is unlikely  although the bribery charges could in theory allow it  if the amount is as huge as they say "	2	1	2
At the congress  Chinese President Hu Jintao will step down as party chief  almost certainly making way for Vice President Xi Jinping to emerge as top leader 	3	1	1
Xi is then almost sure to be appointed state president at the annual parliament session  likely in March next year 	3	1	1
"Bo  63  has been expelled from the party as well as the elite decision-making Politburo and Central Committee ""in view of his errors and culpability in the Wang Lijun incident and the intentional homicide case involving Bogu Kailai""  said the party announcement "	2	1	3
Bogu is his wife's official but rarely used surname 	1	1	1
Party organizations at all levels must use the case of Bo Xilai's grave disciplinary violations as a negative example  it said 	2	1	2
He appears to be still in the United States  after finishing graduate studies at Harvard University 	3	1	1
At the same time as announcing the slate of accusations against Bo  the party set the November 8 date for the congress that will unveil the country's new central leadership line-up 	1	1	1
Eight is considered a lucky number in China 	1	1	1
Bo  63  was widely seen as pursuing a powerful spot in the new political line-up before his career unraveled after his former police chief  Wang Lijun  fled to a U S  consulate for more than 24 hours in February and alleged that Bo's wife Gu had poisoned Heywood to death 	2	1	3
"After his appointment as party chief of Chongqing in 2007  Bo  a former commerce minister  turned it into a showcase of revolution-inspired ""red"" culture and his policies for egalitarian  state-led growth "	1	1	1
He also won national attention with a crackdown on organized crime 	1	1	2
But his populist ways and crime clean-up were welcomed by many of Chongqing's 30 million residents  as well as others who hoped that Bo could take his leftist-shaded policies nationwide 	2	1	2
After state television announced the charges against Bo  some leftist sympathizers insisted that he was the innocent victim of a political plot 	2	1	2
I just still don't believe that Bo has so many problems with corruption  Han Deqiang  a leftist Beijing academic who has supported Bo  told Reuters 	2	1	2
"We have to wait and see what else comes out	2	1	1 
127 china-seals-bos-fate-ahead-november-8-leadership-032810117 But I don't think we've been given the truth "	2	1	2
In March  Bo was sacked as Chongqing party boss  and in April he was suspended from the party's Politburo  a powerful decision-making council with two dozen active members 	2	1	1
It added that the investigation discovered clues of other  unspecified crimes 	1	1	2
We'll have to wait and see what charges are accepted by the prosecutors in any indictment  said Li Zhuang  a Beijing lawyer who was jailed by Bo after raising allegations that Chongqing's anti-crime gang policies involved torture and other unchecked abuses 	2	1	3
The charges could change 	2	1	1
China seeks to discredit Bo  supporters cry foul	2	1	2
BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese government pressed ahead on Saturday with an effort to discredit fallen politician Bo Xilai  drawing an outcry from leftist supporters of the former leadership contender in a sign of the rifts that his prosecution could inflame 	3	1	3
The party issued the damning accusations at the same time that it announced a November 8 for a congress that will anoint a new generation of top leaders - a lineup that Bo held barely disguised ambitions to join 	2	1	3
Bo's downfall has unsteadied preparations for that leadership succession  and exposed revelations of high-level abuse of power after his former police chief briefly took refuge in a United States consulate and exposed allegations that Bo's wife  Gu Kailai  murdered a British businessman 	3	1	4
State media tried to draw a clear line between Bo and the party elite he once belonged to  casting his fall as a victory for the party's determination to fight corruption 	2	2	2
No matter how high a position  no matter how influential  anyone who violates party discipline and state law will be sternly pursued and punished  said a commentary on the case issued by the official Xinhua news agency 	3	2	2
As a senior party official  Bo Xilai should have been a model of obedience to party discipline  it said 	3	2	2
But instead he monopolized power and behaved recklessly  doing as he pleased and gravely violating discipline  added the commentary  which was widely distributed by state media websites 	3	1	3
His misdeeds deserve their punishment 	3	1	3
The party could face trouble  however  convincing skeptics that it has only recently awoken to Bo's crimes  which it traced way back to his years as a city official in northeast China 	3	1	3
Bo's leftist supporters have already revived charges that Bo is the victim of a plot to eradicate him and his populist policies 	2	2	2
"Last night  one of the core members of the ruling party's leadership was suddenly turned into a demon  said one commentary on ""Red China""  a far-left Chinese-language website that has issued a torrent of commentary defending Bo "	3	2	2
Unlike other ousted senior officials  Bo Xilai's downfall has triggered two diametrically opposed reactions in society - one of elation and relief  and the other of outrage and regret 	3	3	3
"The ""Red China"" site has been blocked to the many Chinese users who do not know how to evade censorship barriers "	3	1	3
"But China's version of Twitter  ""Weibo""  has also echoed with debate about Bo's dramatic downfall "	2	1	2
Public support for Bo is unlikely to creep into the heavily regimented party congress  but the effort to disgrace him could foster deeper public disillusionment with the party by showing that one of its formerly favored officials was steeped in corruption 	3	1	3
That's probably quite polarizing because you are not talking about just a few people but a segment of the whole of Chinese society and the establishment 	3	2	2
After arriving in Chongqing in 2007  Bo turned it into a showcase for pro-growth economics  and ran a campaign against organized crime  policies welcomed by many of the city's 30 million residents  though his brash self-promotion irked some leaders in Beijing 	2	3	2
Bo's wife Gu Kailai and his former police chief Wang Lijun have already been jailed over the scandal stemming from the murder in November of British businessman Neil Heywood 	2	1	4
"The official statement carried by Xinhua said that in the murder scandal  Bo ""abused his powers of office  committed serious errors and bears a major responsibility """	3	1	4
The government also accused Bo of taking huge bribes and other unspecified crimes 	3	1	4
Before Bo is charged and tried  investigators must first complete an inquiry and indict him  but China's prosecutors and courts come under party control and are most unlikely to challenge the accusations 	3	1	3
China trade minister to visit Canada  could mention CNOOC bid	2	1	1
CNOOC said it did not expect Chen to raise the sensitive takeover bid during talks with the Canadian government 	2	1	1
Canada China Business Council president Peter Harder  however  said he would not be surprised if Chen mentioned it in a speech to his group next Tuesday 	2	1	1
Although Canada is seeking substantial foreign investment in its oil and gas industry  the CNOOC move is raising concern inside cabinet  where some members are wary of letting a Chinese state-owned enterprise buy up domestic assets 	2	1	2
Industry ministry officials are looking closely at the bid to determine whether it is of net benefit to Canada 	1	1	1
Separately  Canada's spy service said some foreign state-owned enterprises could pose a threat to national security 	1	1	2
It did not mention China by name 	1	1	1
I do expect it will be a productive meeting as we move the Canada-China relationship forward  he told reporters on Friday 	1	2	1
Nexen - whose shareholders voted to accept the CNOOC deal on Thursday - said it was unaware of Chen's visit 	1	1	1
"A spokesman for CNOOC said it did not expect Chen and Fast to discuss the bid ""because this is transaction between two commercial companies  not a government to government affair"" "	1	1	1
The Chinese embassy was not immediately available for comment 	1	1	1
China's Ministry of Commerce is responsible for authorizing investments of more than $100 million by state-owned enterprises 	1	1	1
When Chen addresses a lunch arranged by the Canada China Business Council next week in Toronto  he could well talk about the CNOOC bid  council president Harder said  noting the minister had done so in a speech in Beijing last week 	2	1	1
I think he would express the view that the transaction should be looked at as a business transaction and be seen on its merits and that China would hope that that would be the case  he told Reuters in a phone interview 	2	1	1
Harder said that in Chen's Beijing speech last week  he had mentioned a foreign investment promotion and protection agreement signed by Canada and China this month as well as China's willingness to broaden economic relations between the two countries 	1	2	1
It is also promoting the idea of oil sales to China 	1	1	1
Critics of the CNOOC deal point out that China is running a large trade surplus with Canada 	1	1	1
They also complain Canadian natural resources companies find it hard to operate in China 	1	1	2
Canada's spy service  in a report issued on Thursday  said some bids by state-owned enterprises to gain control over strategic sectors of the Canadian economy could threaten national security interests 	1	1	2
The foreign entities might well exploit that control in an effort to facilitate illegal transfers of technology or to engage in other espionage and other foreign interference activities  the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) said 	2	1	2
CSIS expects that national security concerns related to foreign investment in Canada will continue to materialize 	2	1	2
The official opposition New Democratic Party says it is concerned about a Chinese state-owned firm buying what they call a strategic Canadian asset 	1	1	2
Nexen controls less than 5 percent of the crude-rich tar sands in the western province of Alberta  one of the world's biggest oil deposits  where its Canadian properties are concentrated 	1	1	1
Chris Cuomo Takes on Extreme Fitness (So You Don't Have To)	2	1	1
The only constant in life is change 	2	1	1
That may be true  in general  but it is not always so when it comes to working out 	2	1	1
We like it because we know what to do  how long it will take  and we assume that the repetition will yield gains (or reductions  depending on goals) 	3	2	1
Alas  we are wrong 	2	1	1
Science now shows the body is much more adaptable to routines 	1	1	1
That means that the body starts working less hard asap because it is designed to conserve energy 	1	1	1
But  there is good news!	2	2	1
The way to defeat this is often not by doing more  but by doing less - in terms of duration  anyway 	1	1	1
Turns out  when the body tries something new  the learning curve makes it fire and burn more  yielding quicker results 	1	2	1
We also know that using whole body moves and routines  increase yield even more so 	1	2	1
Add to that  the data suggesting that interval work (alternating spikes and rest periods during cardio or lifting) actually send the body on a fat-burning-frenzy lasting hours after the workout ends 	1	2	1
So  you can get more out of a workout in less time  and the benefits will last much longer than your typical workout 	1	2	1
Sounds too good to be true 	2	2	1
For Men's Health Magazine  I started trying new routines every month or so to see if I could accelerate gains  while also cutting down in the length and frequency of workouts 	3	1	1
As long as you keep your body guessing (read: try new stuff every so often) you will out gain the person who is plodding through the same old cardio and weight slog 	2	2	1
Out of the box I tried a Thai-boxing workout  not because I wanted to get my ass beat  but because I wanted to whup my ass into shape 	4	2	1
The mix of dynamic cardio  striking  and sparring was new and challenging and it worked 	1	2	1
As a guy who already had a solid base of muscle and fitness  I saw my body change from the new routine 	3	1	1
Stronger core  less fat 	1	1	1
Here is the story 	1	1	1
"The theory worked so well that we started shooting video of my often painful introductions to ""what's next """	2	2	1
The first clip was really outside the box for me 	3	1	1
I went a benefit and there was a dance recital  and I was ready for a good nap  when these big  ripped guys  who resembled NFL defensive backs in leotards came bounding on stage 	4	1	1
"Upper-body power comes from traditional weight work  but those springs and abs got some extra work: the Horton Technique  their daily 45-minute ""length is strength"" routine that emphasizes all the assistive muscles in the legs "	1	1	1

The best proof: Sims has not suffered an injury in 15 years of performances 	1	2	1
At least  you will take solace in watching my struggle 	3	2	2

Joe Dowdell knows his fitness science  and has melded what we know about full body workouts and the benefits of disrupting the body's expectations for exertion (muscle confusion  increased metabolic stimulation  and a bunch of other science-y stuff) 	1	2	1
But what makes Joe different and cool is that he has adapted those principles to old-school  strong-man type activities 	3	2	1
It makes for a really different workout 	1	1	1
Pushing a weighted sled  snapping cruise line-sized ropes  throwing a medicine ball  carrying dead weight - it all sounds old-school  and it is 	1	1	1
There's a unique feeling of power when doing these ostensibly primitive movements  and yet the pace and form employed burns you in a way that is motivated by the latest in fitness expertise 	1	1	1
"The result is that Joe  with burst-style  shorter workouts  gets you to train at ""Peak Performance """	1	2	1
Watch me wither 	1	1	1
What should Chris try next?	1	1	1
Pilates?	1	1	1
Parkour?	1	1	1
We are looking to make him the Mike Rowe of workouts… what's the toughest stuff you can toss his way?	1	1	1

Christie's offers Bond items on 50th anniversary	1	1	1
"LONDON (Reuters) - Christie's will offer 50 items of James Bond memorabilia over the coming week in a charity sale that culminates in a live auction next Friday  the 50th anniversary of the release of the first 007 movie ""Dr  No"" "	1	2	1
The auction  which will raise funds for a range of charities including UNICEF  is one of a series of events being held around the world to mark the anniversary of one of the world's longest-running and most successful film franchises 	3	3	1
Fifty lots will be up for sale  many of them coming from EON Productions  the company behind the movie series 	1	1	1
All lots will go on public display there from Saturday until October 4  Admittance is free 	1	2	1
I think what we wanted to do was to celebrate the 50th anniversary in a meaningful way and let people have the opportunity to buy some of the things in our archive that we could raise money for charity from  said Michael G  Wilson  who along with Barbara Broccoli is guardian of the Bond films 	1	2	1
"There's a lot of things     from 1 000 pounds ($1 600) on up  really  he told Reuters  ""There's plenty of things for a whole range of collectors """	2	1	1
"Among the highlights for him was a one-third scale model of an Aston Martin DB5 used in the filming of ""Skyfall""  the next Bond adventure which hits the screens in October "	1	1	1
The car was used in earlier Bonds and has become closely associated with the fictional double agent 	1	1	1
We used it in the film but we had to make a model of it  We made an extra model  one third scale     that was made for the film and I think that's a pretty unique thing to get 	2	1	1
"The model is expected to fetch 30-40 000 pounds  while another Aston Martin built in 2008 and used in the opening sequence of the last Bond movie ""Quantum of Solace"" has a price tag of 100-150 000 pounds "	2	1	1
There is also a special edition of Bollinger champagne on offer for 10-15 000 pounds 	1	1	1
Can you imagine  a champagne that comes out in an edition of 12 only? Wilson said 	2	1	1
He added that Bond producers had been working with a number of charities for some time  although their ties to UNICEF  the United Nations Children's Fund  were particularly close through the involvement of former Bond actor Roger Moore 	2	2	1
"Among the smaller items being sold are 10 tarot cards used by Jane Seymour playing the character Solitaire in ""Live and Let Die"" and a belt with a golden bullet buckle worn by Christopher Lee as Scaramanga in ""The Man With the Golden Gun"" "	1	1	1
Chuck Norris ambushed on Slovak bridge to freedom	2	2	2
BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovak officials rejected the overwhelming results of a popular Internet campaign to name a new pedestrian and cycling bridge near the capital after U S  action film star Chuck Norris 	2	2	3
"Despite 12 599 votes for the Norris name in a two-month online poll  Bratislava regional assembly decided to call the bridge spanning the Morava river and Slovakia's border with Austria the ""Freedom Cycling-Bridge"" in memory of people killed attempting to escape communist eastern Europe "	3	2	2
"The assembly's choice earned only 457 votes in the online poll  where it was easily outshone by other proposed names  including ""Maria Theresa"" after an Austro-Hungarian empress and ""the Devinska cycling bridge"" in honour of a nearby village "	3	2	2
It truly is a place where people were running for freedom through barbed wire  it is a place where many have died  so this is a dignified way how to honour these people 	3	3	2
Slovakia  once part of the former Czechoslovakia  has a 107 km border with Austria and many people died trying to flee the communist regime before its collapse in 1989 	1	1	3
"Norris  a martial arts expert-turned film star  is known for playing tough guy characters in such classic movies as ""Lone Wolf McQuade""  ""Missing in Action"" and ""The Delta Force"" "	2	2	1
The actor's work has become a popular source of kitschy fun among Slovaks and a mainstay for local jokes about macho strength and invincibility 	2	3	1
Cloverfield director Matt Reeves signs overall deal With 20th Century Fox TV	1	1	1
Under the agreement  Reeves will write and create his own projects  as well as supervise drama projects from others 	1	1	1
Reeves also will direct projects that are deemed a high priority for 20th TV 	1	1	1
"Though Reeves has been better known for such big-screen efforts as ""Cloverfield"" and ""Let Me In"" in recent years  his TV credits are numerous  including co-creating the WB drama ""Felicity"" with J J  Abrams "	1	1	1
Colorado 'Frozen Dead Guy' festival to go on with or without corpse	1	2	2
"DENVER (Reuters) - The frozen corpse that has inspired a Colorado town's whimsical ""Frozen Dead Guy Days"" celebration may soon be put on ice somewhere else  but festival organizers said the body's removal will not have a chilling effect on the annual event "	2	2	2
We will continue on whether or not Bredo Morstoel is here  festival owner Amanda MacDonald said Wednesday of the man whose body has been packed in dry ice outside Nederland  Colorado  since 1993 	1	2	1
A financial dispute between Morstoel's grandson  Tryve Bauge  and the man hired to replenish the dry ice on a monthly basis  Bo Shaffer  has led to Bauge threatening to move his grandfather's body out of Colorado 	2	1	2
But Shaffer said he quit after Bauge refused to pay for the rising costs of fuel and ice  which has made the endeavour unprofitable 	1	1	2
It takes two of us to make the four-hour roundtrip  Shaffer told Reuters 	1	1	1
My quitting is the only way to get his (Bauge's) attention 	3	1	1
Bauge  who lives in Norway  did not immediately return an email message seeking comment about the dispute 	1	1	1
But he told the Boulder Daily Camera newspaper that he is exploring the possibility of moving his grandfather to the Cryonics Institute in Michigan 	1	1	1
Cryonics is the process of freezing and storing a corpse to prevent decomposition in anticipation of medical technology that could bring the dead back to life 	1	1	1
Liquid nitrogen  which is far colder than dry ice  is typically used for cryonic preservation 	1	1	1
Ultimately he had the corpse moved to Nederland  where Bauge lived at the time 	1	1	1
But they ultimately embraced the idea of an annual festival surrounding its most famous  albeit deceased  resident 	2	2	1
The late-winter celebration features activities such as coffin races  a hearse parade  a frozen salmon toss and snow beach volleyball 	1	1	1
There are even tours to the site of Morstoel's sarcophagus  although his remains are not open for viewing 	2	1	1
MacDonald said the festival attracts about 10 000 people over its three-day run  which is held in early March  and has taken on a life of its own  with or without its namesake dead guy 	2	2	1
The nonprofit Cryonics Institute in Clinton Township  Michigan  was founded by the late physicist Robert Ettinger  who was known as a pioneer in cryonics 	1	1	1
His son  David Ettinger  said by telephone that privacy concerns prevent him from discussing any potential patients 	1	1	1
However  he did say ideal candidates for suspension are people who have recently died 	1	1	1
Such was the case with his father  he said  who was prepared for the procedure in the days before his death in 2011 at the age of 92 	1	1	1
We've never had a patient presented to us under those circumstances  he said of a corpse that has been packed in dry ice for nearly two decades 	1	1	1
"The institute has about 100 suspended corpses  and charges a one-time $35 000 fee and $120 annually for ""human cryopreservation """	1	1	1
Column: Be wary of spies at the Ryder Cup	2	1	2
MEDINAH  Ill 	1	1	1
(AP) — There are  apparently  spies lurking on the golf course  which is why the Americans have been so careful in practice this week to avoid putting toward anything that looks as if it might be a possible hole location in the Ryder Cup 	3	1	2
It seems a bit silly  but for the people involved in this biennial golf match between a country and a continent  this is serious stuff 	3	2	3
Cutting the rough down could determine another match 	2	1	1
That could be the difference between Europe retaining the Ryder Cup  or the U S  winning the little trophy that no one ever cared much about before the Euros started taking it away 	2	2	2
And that might be the difference between a golf world dominated by people whose ancestors invented the game or those who helped perfect it 	2	2	2
Should I go on?	2	1	1
Never mind that the 12 Europeans are fairly sophisticated players who should be able to read a putt if it was in a canyon on Mars 	3	2	1
For the most part they've all shown they can play under pressure  even if Michael Jordan is following them in his golf cart with a menacing look on his face 	3	2	2
There's no logic to it  as evidenced by Tiger Woods being on only one winning team in his career 	2	1	2
Davis Love III might not have a book in him  even if the U S  captain manages to lead his charges to a win in this one 	2	2	1
Still  some questions remain to be answered before play finally begins Friday morning 	1	1	1
Among them are:	1	1	1
Woods is a mediocre 13-14-2 in the Ryder Cup  so his new cheerful attitude with his playing partners — the intimidator McIlroy in particular — can't hurt 	2	2	1
—Will Medinah Country Club with no rough favor the U S  as Love hopes?	2	1	1
Or should he also have ordered all the ponds drained just in case an errant shot by one of the Americans went toward the water?	2	1	1
Europeans  as we have found out in recent Ryder Cups  have special balls that are magnetically repelled from both rough and water during crucial matches 	3	2	2
—Will Europeans understand what a red-out is?	2	1	2
The PGA of America is taking a page from collegiate arenas by asking fans to wear red on Sunday to support the home team 	2	2	1
Might work  though comically enough the PGA also is asking fans at home to wear red  too 	3	2	1
—Does ping pong really strengthen the soul?	2	2	1
For some reason  U S  players like to play ping pong — and a lot of it 	2	2	1
They're convinced ping pong brings the team together  and to make sure they've got three tables in the team room this year instead of two 	4	3	1
—Will the U S  have another equipment malfunction?	2	1	2
It rained at the Ryder Cup in Wales two years ago on the opening day  and U S  players were soaked in their leaky rain gear 	1	1	2
They never seemed to recover  and Europe ended up regaining the cup 	1	2	2
—Will Jordan as an assistant coach advise the U S  to play zone or man-to-man against the Euros?	2	1	1
More importantly  will he step up to take out McIlroy with a well-placed screen if needed?	2	1	1
Imagine the possibilities on Sunday with tens of thousands of well lubricated fans cheering the home team on 	1	1	1
It's all been analyzed more than Jim Furyk's swing  picked apart more than Tiger's brain 	1	1	1
If recent Ryder Cup history is any example  though  it's not all that difficult to figure out 	1	1	1
Common heart drugs may be less helpful than thought	1	1	2
"Although the study is not conclusive  it ""is definitely going to make some waves "" said Dr  Lydia Bazzano of Tulane University in New Orleans  who studies heart disease prevention  but wasn't part of the new work "	2	2	2
I think there are probably plenty of people out there who are getting (beta-blockers)  but don't need them  Bazzano told Reuters Health 	2	1	2
Beta-blockers such as atenolol and metoprolol slow the heartbeat and lower blood pressure 	1	1	1
They are known to shield against future heart attacks in people who just had one and can be helpful in certain types of heart failure  Older studies have suggested staying on beta-blockers in the long run may be beneficial  so many doctors have their patients take the drugs indefinitely 	1	2	1
But those results predate modern treatment  researchers say  And whether or not beta-blockers can ward off heart attacks in the first place is still up in the air 	1	1	2
Because beta-blockers are now off patent  drug companies have little incentive to study their effects in expensive clinical trials - the gold-standard in medical science for demonstrating what a treatment does and does not do 	1	1	2
So Dr  Sripal Bangalore of the NYU Langone Medical Center in New York and colleagues did the next-best thing  They used data from a registry of nearly 45 000 people with established coronary artery disease or risk factors for heart disease to get a sense of the drugs' efficacy 	1	1	2
In coronary artery disease  or CAD  the blood vessels supplying the heart are partially clogged by cholesterol buildups  which can lead to heart attacks 	1	1	2
The researchers sliced the registry according to whether people had suffered a heart attack  had CAD but no past heart attack  or just had risk factors such as diabetes and high blood pressure 	1	1	2
Among people with risk factors alone  14 2 percent of those on beta-blockers had a bad outcome versus 12 percent of non-users 	1	1	1
There was no difference in outcomes overall among people with prior heart attacks who did or did not use beta-blockers  However  those who'd suffered a heart attack within the past year and took beta-blockers seemed to be slightly less likely to fare ill or land in the hospital due to their condition 	2	2	2
Beta-blockers are cheap - a month's supply of the generic versions can be bought for less than $10 - but often cause side effects  including fatigue  depression and nightmares 	1	1	2
"I think there has been a movement away from beta-blockers  said Bazzano  including as a blood pressure medication  ""A lot of people don't like to be on them """	2	1	2
Dr  Harlan Krumholz  a cardiologist who was not involved in the new study  said it is consistent with recent guidelines from the American Heart Association 	1	1	1
"The group says beta-blockers are most effective in the first three years after a heart attack and in patients with certain types of heart failure  In other cases  their use is ""optional "" according to 2011 guidelines "	1	1	2
"Krumholz  of Yale School of Medicine in New Haven  Connecticut  said he often leaves patients on beta-blocker therapy ""forever"" after a heart attack "	1	1	2
This is raising the question of whether or not we need to keep them on it  he said 	1	1	1
He cautioned that there may be specific reasons why doctors would still put patients with heart disease on beta-blockers  such as high blood pressure or chest pain 	2	1	2
"But in general  Krumholz concluded  ""The best thing is for every patient to be on as few medicines as possible  and only the ones that are the most helpful to them """	2	2	1
"Tintin's relationship with Congo dates back to 1930 when his creator Georges Remi - better-known by his pen name Herge - first wrote ""Tintin in the Congo""  in which the intrepid reporter and his little white dog Snowy tackle wild animals  hunters  diamond smugglers and warlike local chieftains "	2	1	2
Tintin statues - which can sell for anything from $15 to $1500 - are part of Congo's roaring trade in the comic's memorabilia  business that could receive a boost next month as delegates from 56 countries across the French-speaking world gather in Kinshasa for the Francophonie summit 	2	2	1

But it is Herge's heavily stereotyped depiction of Africans as fat-lipped  childlike savages that makes Tintin a controversial cultural figure for a country trying to turn its back on a brutal colonial past followed by decades of dictatorship and conflict  according to professor Joseph Ibongo Gilungule  the director of Congo's national museum 	2	1	3
Tintin is an image created by westerners  and it proves the ignorance of these people  a lack of understanding for our values  Ibongo told Reuters 	3	1	2
Ibongo wants more people to celebrate the rich cultures of the country's estimated 250 ethnic groups 	3	2	1
Ibongo is not against preserving relics of Congo's colonial past - he is trying to find money to rehabilitate the statue of controversial British colonial explorer Henry Morton Stanley  which lies forlornly toppled behind a shed at the museum 	2	1	1
Nonetheless  with so many people due to visit the country for the Francophonie summit in October  he believes Congo should find a better poster boy than Tintin 	3	1	1
"There are other strong images which speak positively of this country  its peoples	3	2	1
137 congo-questions-tintins-cultural-status-ahead-francophonie-163818299 It would be more respectful to Congo and the whole of Africa if we spoke of images that value the Congo  and not Tintin  Ibongo added "	3	2	1
Earlier this year a Congolese man studying in Belgium tried and failed to have the book banned on the grounds of racism 	1	1	2
Even Tintin's creator Herge later re-wrote parts of the story  toning down the more extreme stereotypes which sprang from Belgium's colonisation of Congo  which was brutal even by the standards of the day 	2	1	2
Auguy Kakese  an artisan who specialises in Tintin statuettes  acknowledges that it was Europeans who first suggested he carve the figures and most of his clients remain westerners 	2	1	1
But he sees no harm in it 	2	1	1
Although most of the statues Kakese sells are of the comic's European characters  he does not shy away from depicting the Africans as well  despite them seeming uncomfortably stereotyped for modern tastes 	2	1	2
We were a Belgian colony  if we work with Tintin now it's to say that the Belgians are still our brothers  he added 	3	2	1
A recent showing in Kinshasa of the Steven Spielberg-directed Tintin movie attracted a small but varied audience  everyone from Congolese to Koreans 	2	1	1
Christiana Finotti  an Italian expatriate  said she had bought a Tintin picture for her friend but acknowledged that not all her Congolese colleagues were comfortable with the association 	2	1	2
(Reuters) - A Connecticut man responding to his sister's call for help during an apparent burglary at her home next door  shot and killed a masked intruder who turned out to be his own teenage son  state police said on Friday 	1	1	3
Tyler Giuliano  15  was wearing a ski mask and appeared to be armed when he was shot on Thursday by his father  who authorities declined to identify  said Lieutenant J  Paul Vance  a spokesman for the Connecticut State Police 	1	1	3
The father's sister  who lives next door  was home alone before 1 a m  when she called him to report someone trying to break into her home 	1	1	1
The father went over to investigate and was approached by a masked person dressed entirely in black and holding a shiny object  police said in a statement 	1	1	1
Believing the suspect was armed with a weapon and about to attack him  the (father) discharged his personal handgun at the suspect  police said in the statement 	1	1	2
Giuliano was pronounced dead at the scene 	1	1	3
(He) was lying on the ground in the driveway with obvious gunshot injuries  holding a weapon  the statement said 	2	1	2
Police also were investigating why the teen  who has no criminal history  was outside his aunt's home 	1	1	1
ConocoPhillips to exit Kazakh oil field: minister	2	1	1
ASTANA (Reuters) - U S  oil major ConocoPhillips is ready to exit the consortium developing Kazakhstan's Kashagan oil field  Kazakh officials said  giving the state first option on increasing ownership of the biggest oil find since the 1960s 	3	1	1
"Asked on Tuesday whether ConocoPhillips would sell its stake in the consortium  Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev told reporters: ""They have informed that they have the intention of selling """	3	2	1
ConocoPhillips would not confirm its plans for the Kashagan stake 	1	1	1
Unless formally announced by our company  ConocoPhillips does not comment on ongoing business development or commercial activities  spokesman Daren Beaudo said in an email 	3	1	1
The Houston-based company  however  has been conducting a disposal program to reduce its non-core overseas assets 	1	1	1
It has already exceeded its target of asset sales worth $20 billion by the end of 2012  including the sale of its stake in LUKOIL   Russia's second-biggest oil producer 	2	1	1
Proceeds from the disposals are to be used for debt reduction  dividend payments and exploration 	1	3	1
Kazakhstan  home to 3 percent of the world's recoverable oil reserves  has moved to exert greater management control and secure bigger revenues from foreign-owned oil and gas developments 	2	2	1
Previous reshuffles of North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC)  the consortium developing Kashagan  have seen state company KazMunaiGas muscle in  prompting Western partners to seek assurances that they will be able to develop the offshore field's more lucrative second phase 	2	2	1
KazMunaiGas first entered the Kashagan consortium as a shareholder in 2005 and later doubled its stake to 16 81 percent 	1	1	1
Identical stakes are held by Exxon Mobil   Royal Dutch Shell   Italy's Eni and French company Total  	1	1	1
Japan's Inpex <1605 T> owns 7 56 percent 	1	1	1
"The Kazakh state company would have first option on buying the 8 4 percent stake owned by ConocoPhillips  and Chief Executive Lyazzat Kiinov said it was ""displaying interest"" in buying the stake "	2	2	1
Daniyar Berlibayev  Kiinov's deputy at KazMunaiGas  also indicated that ConocoPhillips planned to sell its stake 	2	1	1
They will exit the project  but nobody has come to us with an offer  Berlibayev told Reuters 	3	1	1
"We  as the national company  wouldn't refuse the idea of increasing our share	3	2	1
139 conocophillips-exit-kazakh-oil-field-minister-143431817--finance How we might finance this is another question "	3	1	1
Exxon Mobil  the world's biggest non-state oil company  would be a possible buyer of the stake if KazMuaniGas decided not to pursue its interest in the ConocoPhillips stake 	2	1	1
Exxon Mobil senior vice-president Mark Albers declined to comment when asked about his company's plans for Kashagan 	1	1	1
Kazakhstan  the world's ninth-largest country by area but with a population of only 17 million  expects Kashagan to be one of three main drivers of its plans to raise oil output by 60 percent by the end of the decade 	2	2	1
Kashagan's first phase  which has been delayed by rising costs and technical complications  is likely to pump its first oil by the end of March 2013  the minister said 	3	2	2
A second phase  yet to be agreed with the government  could raise output to 1 million bpd 	2	1	1
With output set to begin  consortium members are lobbying for assurances that they will be able to recoup the tens of billions of dollars already invested before the expiry of their 40-year production-sharing agreement  signed in 1997 	2	2	2
"President Nursultan Nazarbayev  who has ruled Kazakhstan throughout its two decades of independence  has already talked to ENI Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni to discuss ""cooperation in the oil and gas sector""  including Kashagan  his website said "	3	2	1

Crickets causing a stink in Central Texas city	1	1	2
WACO  Texas (AP) — Several businesses in the Central Texas town of Waco (WAY'-koh) are dealing with a smelly problem that won't go away: decaying cricket carcasses 	1	1	3
A bank  a drugstore and other businesses have been inundated with the odorous onslaught of dead crickets that have been trapped inside walls and have collected on sidewalks 	1	1	3
that scented products have been unable to get rid of the smell 	1	1	2
Using air-scrubbing machines hasn't worked either 	1	1	2
Fred Huffman  an entomologist who runs a local pest control business  says the cricket problem has been worse this year because mild winter conditions resulted in the insects appearing earlier than normal 	1	1	2
Health officials say the crickets don't pose any direct health risks 	1	2	1
Crime at the US-Mexico border goes corporate	2	1	3
BROWNSVILLE  Texas (AP) — When a regional manager for the Mexican Gulf cartel moved his operation to a more lucrative territory on the border  he took along not only his armored trucks and personal army  but also his department heads and a team of accountants 	2	1	4
It's easy to lose sight of the fact that  ultimately  these criminal organizations are complex businesses  relying on careful accounting as much as assault rifles 	2	1	4
Crossfit takes a tough  no-frills approach to exercise	3	2	2
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Forget the leisurely workout 	4	1	2
Crossfit training is a high-intensity  no-frills strength and conditioning program to get fit 	3	2	2
Used by fire departments  the military  college sports teams and in gyms  Crossfitters tackle an array of physical challenges and follow daily workouts posted on a website 	1	1	2
"I really do like them in terms of the strength and the challenge  said Liz Neporent  the author of ""Fitness for Dummies  said about the exercises """	1	2	1
"Why not maximize your time?	1	2	1 
143 crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865 If you're going to do it  do it	1	2	1
143 crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865 Don't fool around "	1	1	1
Crossfit training is the invention of Greg Glassman  a gymnastics coach who opened the first Crossfit facility in Santa Cruz  California in 1995 	1	1	1
Crossfit is more of a movement than an organization  Neporent said 	1	2	1
There's a website but it's basically individuals  gyms  and groups doing it 	1	2	1
"Today I'm doing 100 squats  100 push-ups  100 crunches  said Neporent  ""which is about half a WOD """	1	2	1
A lot of people  she said  would not be able to walk afterwards 	1	2	1
"That's what you have to understand about Crossfit	1	1	1
143 crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865 For some people it's aspirational "	1	1	2
For Kirch  one exercise  called the burpee  illustrates the love-hate relationship Crossfitters have to their WOD 	1	2	2
He said from a standing position you squat down  put your hands on the floor  kick your feet behind you 	1	1	1
Then you lower yourself to the floor  push up  jump to your feet  stand up and jump in the air 	1	1	1
It's a move everyone dreads  he said 	1	2	1
"But no matter what someone's fitness level  if they do just a few they'll quickly build up to more	1	2	1 
143 crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865 It's immediate satisfaction "	1	2	1
The rest of the time is spent on stretching  warming up and on technique 	1	1	1
We don't have machines  Kirch said 	1	1	1
We don't have treadmills or cardio equipment or strength training machines 	1	1	1
Most things are based around body weight and barbells  he explained 	1	1	1
If someone says they've been doing Crossfit at another gym  we'll do a test to make sure they know the movements  he said 	1	2	1
American Council on Exercise spokesperson Jessica Matthews said her maiden Crossfit session left her with a major sweat and a pretty strong feeling of empowerment 	1	2	2
I like the style  said Matthews  an exercise physiologist 	1	2	1
Matthews's session also included a two-lap warm-up run around the block and a few rounds on a rowing machine 	1	1	1
"Trickier for her is what she calls the ""scalability portion"" of the Crossfit philosophy: the notion that it works for everyone from the elite athlete to the overweight grandmother "	1	2	2
You go for time  she said of the WODs 	1	2	1
We know that when we manipulate intensity by adding variables like speed  people not as seasoned may sacrifice initial base form 	1	2	2
She was nonetheless delighted that instead of the tough talk so characteristic of Crossfit websites  which usually promise that butts will be kicked and specialists punished  camaraderie and encouragement ruled the WOD 	1	3	2
The environment was intense but not intimidating  she said 	1	2	1
"They (her 10 session mates) looked like average people doing the workouts	1	1	1
143 crossfit-takes-tough-no-frills-approach-exercise-142756865 We're all in the box "	1	1	1
Crucial vote nears in Boeing contract talks	2	1	1
"Hundreds of engineers and technicians marched at the company's two plants  its downtown Seattle office and other facilities with signs saying ""Boeing: Hands Off My Healthcare"" and ""We Delivered "	1	1	1
"Will Boeing?"""	1	1	1
It was the most visible sign of rising tension over contracts covering 23 000 members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace 	2	1	1
Stan Sorscher  a Speea labor representative and former engineer  estimated the chance of a strike at 35 percent 	2	1	1
Scott Hamilton  managing director at consulting firm Leeham Co   said Boeing likely will make a second contract offer and that will restart negotiations 	2	1	1
We believe we can get to an agreement  said Doug Alder  a Boeing spokesman 	3	2	1
Nobody here is talking about a strike 	2	1	1
Still officials and analysts say it is worrying that Boeing's first offer is going to a vote amid worker rallies 	1	1	1
Boeing has a backlog of 4 057 orders  and is racing to speed up its factories to make more jets  especially 787 Dreamliners  whose customers have been waiting through years of delays 	1	1	2
Boeing also is deciding on specifications for a new derivative of its popular 777 	2	2	1
And it needs engineers to help repair a number of 787s that rolled off the line with flaws and must be fixed before they can be delivered 	1	1	2
While in limbo  the jets weigh on Boeing's financial performance  analysts said 	1	1	1
A strike by Speea would cripple Boeing  said Ray Goforth  Speea's executive director 	3	1	2
They cannot deliver airplanes without our members who are involved in certifying jets before they go to customers 	2	1	1
For the union  a strike could reduce its relevance and its ranks  which already are under pressure from retirement of senior workers and outsourcing 	2	1	2
Boeing has moved large amounts of engineering work to its suppliers and aims to move more despite the technical problems and cost overruns that resulted from using foreign engineers for the 787 	1	1	2
Various engineering groups did not coordinate well  and key pieces  such as wings  did not work well and needed to be re-engineered 	1	1	2
Boeing attributes those problems at least in part to flawed execution of the distributed engineering model  not the model itself  and says it will continue to tap engineers from anywhere  even if not from Speea's mostly Puget Sound workforce 	1	1	2
Boeing has more rules  regulations and guidelines than any company I've ever seen  he said 	4	1	1
If the employees start strictly complying with all of them  you'd see productions problems immediately and the employees would still be collecting paychecks 	3	1	2
Boeing's stock price  which closed at $69 60 on Friday  up 12 percent in the last year  likely would fall  and plane deliveries would be delayed 	2	1	3
I hope they resolve it  Tim Clark  president of Emirates airline  Boeing's biggest 777 customer with 75 unfilled orders  said of the labor trouble while in Seattle on Thursday 	2	2	1
I hope our orders and those of others help give them a way through 	2	2	1
The two sides face another issue: Age 	1	1	1
"These experienced problem-solvers are referred to as the ""bow wave "" because once they depart  Boeing has relatively few experienced engineers behind them to take over "	2	2	2
Boeing actively recruits engineers at all levels 	1	2	1
Our goal is to always retain the best talent and to hire the best talent  Alder said 	2	3	1
Yet engineers with experience working on several different jet programs will be harder to find once older workers retire 	2	1	1
"Engineering skill is ""fast dwindling"" across the aerospace and defense industries  says Tom Captain  an analyst at Deloitte "	3	1	1
"If you go to the website of any aerospace company  you'll see tons of openings for engineers	3	1	1
144 crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance We can't fill the jobs that we need to fill right now "	2	1	1
Among the lower-paid technicians  56 percent are 50 or older 	1	1	1
The recession kept older engineers working - a few are in their 70s and 80s 	1	1	1
Now  as the economy improves  older workers will retire  Captain predicts 	3	2	1
The people who are most valuable and able to mentor and teach the younger ones are retiring because of age  he says 	2	2	1
The union says the average annual engineer income is $110 000 	1	1	1
That should fall in coming years  since the average salary of new and re-hired engineers is $81 000  according to Speea's calculations using records from Boeing 	2	1	1
Local officials say they are puzzled at how the situation has unfolded 	3	1	1
Some compare the current tension to 2008  when they say Boeing's Chicago leaders thought the offer to the machinists union would be accepted by members 	2	1	1
I think Chicago is making the same mistake with Speea  said Hamilton  at Leeham  referring to the company's Midwestern headquarters 	3	1	2
He thinks members will strongly reject the contract 	3	1	1
Boeing's contract offers raises of 3 5 percent every year for engineers for four years 	1	1	1
We would ask them to pay more and the company would also be paying more  Alder said 	2	2	2
"Our goal is to maintain the current plan	2	1	1
144 crucial-vote-nears-boeing-contract-talks-161723525--finance Any increase in medical costs would be offset by the increase in salary "	2	2	2
The union says the contract also would allow Boeing to eliminate medical benefits for retired employees  a charge Boeing denies 	2	2	2
Boeing has no plans to eliminate retiree medical benefits for current retirees  the company said 	2	2	1
Alder said that questions about wording would have been discussed had the sides stayed at the bargaining table 	3	1	1
The union says it is now dealing mostly with negotiators from Chicago  rather than local officials that they know 	2	1	1
Boeing says the negotiating team is unchanged and the company is eager to resume talks  right after Monday's vote  to agree on a new contract 	2	2	1
Cuban-born jazz manager buried in Miami  he was 95	1	1	1
Family members say Jose Curbelo was buried Monday 	1	1	1
He died Friday morning at a hospice in Aventura 	1	1	2
He was 95 	1	1	1
Curbelo left Cuba in 1939 	1	1	1
He worked with some of the greatest Latin music artists  including percussionist Tito Puente 	2	1	1
Amadito Valdes is a Cuban drummer and member of the Buena Vista Social Club 	1	1	1
"He says Curbelo was known as ""a great defender of Latin bands against abuse by promoters """	1	1	1
She said he also had plenty of confidence in who he was  and passed that along to her and her brother 	1	2	1
Cup to showcase teams of unprecedented strength	1	2	1
MEDINAH  Illinois (Reuters) - Fans can expect a high-octane contest between two star-studded teams in this week's Ryder Cup at Medinah where the United States host holders Europe for the 39th edition of the biennial competition 	2	2	1
For the first time in two decades  a European team can boast the game's leading player and in Rory McIlroy they possess a man who has already been targeted by the United States 	1	1	1
"Obviously  he's a marked man  U S  Ryder Cup veteran Jim Furyk said at last week's Tour Championship in Atlanta  ""He's the number one player in the world  He's going to garner all the attention  as well he should  He's played phenomenal this year "	2	3	1
(He) won the PGA (Championship) by a ton of shots     he's right now the present-day Tiger Woods where everyone's eyes are on him 	2	2	1
While double major winner McIlroy heads the world rankings  Europe also have third-ranked Luke Donald  Lee Westwood (four)  Justin Rose (five)  Graeme McDowell (18) and Sergio Garcia (19) among a total of nine players in the top 30 	1	2	1
The U S  counter with 11 in the top 20 - Woods (two)  Bubba Watson (seven)  Webb Simpson (eight)  Jason Dufner (nine)  Steve Stricker (12)  Dustin Johnson (13)  Keegan Bradley (14)  Matt Kuchar (15)  Phil Mickelson (16) and Zach Johnson (17) 	1	1	1
We are really happy with our team  it's really strong  but we have our hands full  There's a strong team on the other side and we'll have to play them real tough 	1	2	1
Europe have triumphed eight times in the last 13 Ryder Cups but they face a challenging task on American soil where the U S  have lost only three times since the matches began in 1927 	2	2	1
"We are playing away and they are going to have the crowd advantage  said European captain Jose Maria Olazabal  ""They are going to set up the course to their liking "	1	1	2
At the end of the day  we are going to have to play really very  very well and hard if we want to have a chance to win 	1	1	2
CLOSELY MATCHED	1	1	1
However  Spaniard Olazabal also felt the two teams would be very closely matched 	1	1	1
"I've always said that I don't see any favourites in this Ryder Cup  he said  ""Both teams are playing very strong  The U S  team is always strong  They have played great "	1	2	1
Since 1981  there has been very little to choose between the two teams in terms of matchplay grit and ability  The knack of holing putts at the right time under intense pressure has been the decisive factor 	1	2	1
The Americans last won the Ryder Cup at Valhalla in 2008 when their captain Paul Azinger shrewdly inspired team cohesion with a four-man 'pod' system and prepared the venue with very little rough and fast greens to suit his power hitters 	1	2	1
This week  U S  captain Davis Love III has set up Medinah Country Club's No  3 Course in similar fashion 	1	1	1
We've set it up the way we think fans will like it  We're a long-hitting  free-wheeling  fun-to-watch team  And I think it's going to be fun to watch 	1	2	1
Woods  the greatest player of his generation and arguably of all time  missed out on the U S  Ryder Cup victory in 2008 while recovering from knee surgery  No surprise  then  that he is eager to taste team success this week at Medinah 	2	2	1
"I've only been part of one winning Ryder Cup team since my (debut) time in '97  he said  ""We didn't play well at the right time  and that's just the way it goes  Hopefully this year we'll play well at the right time """	1	2	1

Czech Republic bans liquor exports to EU after bootleg booze kills 23	1	1	3
PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech government has imposed an immediate ban on all exports of hard liquor to the European Union following the death of 23 people from methyl alcohol poisoning  Prime Minister Petr Necas said on Thursday 	1	1	3
The Czech Republic banned all hard liquor sales in shops and pubs last Friday after the poisonings believed to come from bootleg alcohol 	3	1	3
It plans to gradually reopen the domestic market from the middle of next week  using new tax stamps and certifications of origin to secure the safe origin of drinks 	2	2	1
Czechs set first presidential election for Jan 11-12	1	1	1
PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czechs will hold their first presidential election on January 11 and 12 to replace outgoing euroskeptic leader Vaclav Klaus  the speaker of the upper house of parliament said on Monday 	2	1	1
Up to now  the country's parliament has chosen the president 	1	1	1
Fischer is running as an independent candidate while Zeman has the support of a leftist SPOZ party  a small splinter group from the center-left Social Democratic party he used to lead 	1	1	1
Political analysts say their popularity is another reminder of the public's exasperation with the country's larger  mainstream parties  following a round of harsh austerity measures and sleaze scandals 	3	2	3
Czech presidents do not have the executive powers held by the leaders of France or the United States 	1	1	2
But they wield significant influence over the cabinet and parliament through their ability to delay legislation and appoint prime ministers and other officials 	2	2	1
The office  held by anti-communist dissident and writer Vaclav Havel from 1990-2003  is held in high esteem in the country of 10 5 million people 	2	2	1
Senate speaker Milan Stech said an anticipated second round run-off between the top two candidates for the presidency would take place two weeks after the first round of the election 	1	1	1
Dairy products won't make you skinny  evidence says	1	1	1
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Adding a couple of servings of milk or yogurt to your daily diet probably won't help you drop any pants sizes  according to a new analysis of past studies 	2	1	2
Some research has suggested dairy products may help people feel full for longer  or that the calcium in milk and yogurt can prevent the build-up of fat tissue 	1	1	1
The results are not very consistent  said Dr  Frank Hu  a nutrition researcher from the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston who worked on the new review 	2	1	1
Overall  I think the evidence doesn't support the claim that dairy products are beneficial for weight loss  he said 	3	1	2
Hu and his colleagues analyzed the results of 29 studies including a total of 2 101 participants  some of whom were randomly assigned to add extra dairy to their diets 	1	1	1
The set-ups of those studies varied widely  with dairy intakes ranging from one to more than six servings per day and diet interventions lasting between one month and two years 	1	1	1
On average  people assigned to the extra-dairy groups lost 0 3 more pounds - about 0 14 kilograms - than the comparison group  a difference that could have been due to chance 	1	1	1
They did lose slightly more body fat - about one extra pound worth 	1	1	1
If you wish to measure the effect of physical activity  in an already very active individual or active individuals you have more chance not to see any effect 	2	1	1
Still  even in dairy-deficient people  adding a couple of extra milk or yogurt servings would only be expected to have a small impact on weight  Tremblay said 	2	1	1
The U S  Department of Agriculture recommends teens and adults get three cups of low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt per day 	2	1	1
According to guidelines  one cup of milk is also equivalent to one and a half ounces of natural cheese or two ounces of processed cheese 	1	1	1
But that has to be incorporated into a generally healthy and balanced diet  researchers said 	1	1	1
The bottom line is still energy balance  Hu told Reuters Health 	2	1	1
"For people hoping to control their weight  ""I don't think it's a good idea to add dairy on top of their diet "" he said "	3	1	2
If their baseline dairy is low  if they want to increase their dairy consumption  they have to reduce something else  such as sugar-sweetened drinks or less-healthy protein sources like processed meat 	3	1	1

Data suggest US economy growing only modestly	2	1	2
WASHINGTON (AP) — A spate of data Thursday painted a mixed picture of the U S  economy: Demand for long-lasting manufactured goods fell and slightly fewer people signed contracts to buy homes 	2	1	1
At the same time  the job market looked a little better 	1	2	1
Taken together  the reports suggest the economy is growing only modestly and not quickly enough to spur much hiring 	1	1	2
The news from housing may be improving  but manufacturing is struggling now 	2	1	2
Most of the data seemed discouraging on the surface 	2	1	2
But a closer inspection of the details offered some promise 	1	2	1
— Companies cut orders for long-lasting goods by 13 2 percent in August  the Commerce Department said 	1	1	1
That was the biggest drop in more than three years but it was largely influenced by a 102 percent decline in volatile aircraft orders 	2	1	2
And in a positive sign  orders in a category that reflect business investment plans rose 1 1 percent  the first increase since May 	1	2	1
— The overall economy grew at a 1 3 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter  much lower than the 1 7 percent the government previously estimated 	1	1	1
About half of the downward revision stemmed from the severe drought in the Midwest  which cut overall farm output 	1	1	1
But growth also fell because exports and consumer spending expanded at a slower pace 	1	1	1
— The number of Americans who signed contracts to buy previously occupied homes fell in August from a two-year high in July 	1	1	1
The National Association of Realtors said its index of sales agreements declined 2 6 percent to 99 2 	1	1	1
That's just below the reading of 100 that is considered healthy 	2	1	1
Still  the index is 10 7 percent higher than a year ago 	1	1	1
Economists expect growth to hover near or below 2 percent for the rest of the year 	1	1	1
That's typically too weak to create enough jobs to lower the unemployment rate 	1	1	2
One report appeared to offer some hope that the job market will improve 	2	2	1
When they consistently fall below 375 000  it typically indicates that hiring is strong enough to lower the unemployment rate 	1	2	1
The weekly figures can be volatile  causing most economists to focus on the four-week average 	2	1	1
Economists were mildly encouraged by the unemployment applications 	1	1	1
That's about the same as in August 	1	1	1
The September jobs report will be released next week 	1	1	1
A survey of chief executives  released Wednesday  found a sharp drop in the number of large companies that plan to step up hiring or boost investment in the next six months 	1	1	2
They cited worries over tax and budget policies in the United States and slower growth in Europe and China for the gloomier outlook 	2	1	2
Home prices are rising steadily nationwide 	1	1	1
And sales of new homes remained near a two-year high in August  the Commerce Department said Wednesday 	1	1	1
Dave Grohl says Foo Fighters are taking a break	1	1	2
NEW YORK (AP) — Dave Grohl says his band Foo Fighters is officially taking a break 	1	1	2
Grohl told fans Saturday at the Global Citizen Festival he didn't know when the band would play together again  and affirmed that in the letter 	2	1	2
He created Foo Fighters in 1994 after his time as the drummer in Nirvana  recording the band's self-titled debut before inviting other members to join 	1	1	1
The band has been one of rock 'n' roll's most enduring critical and commercial successes  winning 11 Grammys  including five earlier this year 	3	3	1
Grohl says he's now focused on his forthcoming Sound City documentary and album 	1	2	1
(Reuters) - A California jury on Friday recommended a death sentence for a man found guilty of starting a 2003 wildfire that burned nearly 100 000 acres  damaged more than 1 000 homes and led to the deaths of five people  prosecutors said 	1	1	4
"We take capital punishment seriously	3	1	2
153 death-penalty-recommended-california-man-set-deadly-wildfire-233821603 We don't seek capital punishment on every murder  San Bernardino District Attorney Michael Ramos said "	2	2	2
It's for those people who are most horrendous murderers  rapists - people like Rickie Fowler 	4	1	5
The death sentence recommendation  on which the judge will make a final ruling at a later hearing  comes just over a month before California voters will decide on a November ballot measure whether to repeal the death penalty in a state that is home to nearly a quarter of the nation's death-row inmates 	1	1	2
The October 2003 blaze that Fowler was convicted of starting  called the Old Fire  burned in the San Bernardino Mountains of Southern California  eventually scorching 91 281 acres 	1	1	3
"A 2009 grand jury indictment in the case determined that Fowler  while not the actual killer of the five people  started the fire with ""reckless indifference to human life """	2	2	3
Prosecutors note that individuals who commit a serious violent felony - like robbery  kidnapping  or arson - that results in death are eligible for capital punishment 	1	1	4
While the death penalty remains on the books in California  the state has executed just 13 people since reinstating capital punishment in 1978 	1	2	3
More than 720 inmates sit on death row in California  pending long  expensive appeals 	2	1	3
Fowler had already been sentenced under California's three-strikes law to 75 years to life in prison for committing sodomy against another inmate while behind bars  prosecutors said 	1	1	4
Fowler's defense attorney did not respond to requests for comment 	1	1	1
Debate on bringing wolves to Colo goes to US court	1	1	1
DENVER (AP) — An argument over whether wolves should be returned to Rocky Mountain National Park to reduce an overabundance of elk is moving to a federal appeals court 	1	2	2
The 10th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in Colorado will hear the case Thursday 	1	1	1
The park often has so many elk that they overgraze on trees  shrubs and grass  leaving other animals without enough food and habitat 	2	1	2
The park uses National Park Service personnel and trained volunteers to periodically shoot and kill a specified number of elk 	1	1	3
They cited a lack of support from other agencies  safety concerns of people who live nearby  expected conflicts between wolves and humans and the amount of attention that a wolf population would require of park officials 	1	1	3
The wildlife advocacy group WildEarth Guardians sued the Park Service in 2008  asking a Denver federal court judge to overturn the policy 	1	2	1
The group said the Park Service didn't fully consider reintroducing wolves  and that using volunteers to kill elk amounts to hunting in the park  which would violate federal law 	1	1	3
The judge disagreed  upholding the policy in 2011  and WildEarth Guardians appealed to the 10th Circuit 	1	1	2
The program also includes fencing elk out of some areas to protect vegetation and redistributing some of the animals 	1	2	2
The park website says weather  hunting outside the park and changes in elk movement patterns have helped keep the numbers low 	1	2	1
No decision has been made on whether or how many elk will be killed in the upcoming winter 	1	1	2
Wolves disappeared from many parts of the West after decades of hunting and government-backed extermination 	1	1	3
They were re-introduced in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming in 1995  and some advocates have argued for bringing them back elsewhere 	1	2	1
Wolves ignite heated and emotional debates in the West  with some people saying the predators are a threat to human safety and ranchers' livelihoods  and others arguing they are a vital part of natural ecosystems and inspiring to see in the wild 	1	2	2
"By contrast  the arguments in the lawsuit before the 10th Circuit are largely about dry-sounding procedural questions  chiefly whether the Park Service followed the letter of the law in rejecting wolf reintroduction and whether using trained volunteers to shoot excess elk is ""culling"" or ""hunting """	3	1	3
The 10th Circuit normally meets in Denver but will hear oral arguments in this case at the University of Colorado Law School in Boulder as part of an outreach program 	1	1	1
The debate: Promises kept?	1	1	1
— Forget expectations 	1	1	1
These are domestic policy vulnerabilities  not characterological ones  but they speak to character and mien 	3	1	2
We'll start with Obama's trouble spots 	2	1	1
1  Mortgages 	1	1	1
Why didn't he do more to make whole the nation's record number of delinquencies?	1	1	1
Why did he bail out the banks and not force them to use the money (because  you know  he did force them to use the money in certain ways) to settle with homeowners?	1	1	2
Why have the administration's own programs been mired in bureaucracy?	1	1	1
Why did it take him so long to create an investigatory task force on mortgage fraud?	1	1	2
Did he pick the wrong people?	1	1	2
If he had done things differently  would the middle class be on a more hopeful trajectory?	1	1	2
2  Raising taxes 	1	1	1
Romney's budget-balancing plan is implausible 	2	1	2
If he sticks to that  whatever Congress does  he is going to have to cut spending by a lot more than he currently intends to 	2	1	2
The math for his deficit and debt projections doesn't add up unless all of the Bush tax cuts expire 	2	1	2
Taxes on families who make less than $250 000 a year are going to rise 	1	1	1
3  Health care 	1	1	1
Over and over  Obama reassured those folks with insurance plans they currently like that the Affordable Care Act wouldn't change their health payment arrangements 	1	1	1
This was a technical truth that concealed a misdirection 	2	1	2
It is very likely that insurance companies  forced to offer new benefits  will raise premiums on plans that are currently affordable  or maybe insurance companies will eliminate certain unprofitable policies  or decide they can't do business with certain companies 	2	1	2
It's true that market forces would influence the options offered by insurance companies regardless of whether ObamaCare had passed  but ObamaCare all but guarantees that every major insurance company is going to radically change the menu of plans it offers 	3	1	2
Some people might wind up paying less  but some will pay more 	2	2	2
The Romney-Ryan charge that ObamaCare slashes Medicare has been dealt with elsewhere  but it is true that many health care providers might decide to pass along the costs they must bear to consumers and some  or even a large minority  may start refusing to see Medicare patients altogether because they can't afford to 	2	1	2
5  Jobs 	1	1	1
I don't think Obama thinks he can create jobs without a major bipartisan deficit reduction plan already in place 	5	1	2
It remains a vulnerability because his campaign is (properly) bashing Romney for being vague 	2	1	2
Obama has a record  and that record is a proxy for his future intentions  but it is not a sufficient answer to the jobs question 	1	1	2
Deceased' Conn  Voter Found Alive  Can't Break Tie	1	2	2
A Connecticut judge sought to break a tie between two primary candidates for the General Assembly by opening an uncounted sealed ballot in court Wednesday  only to discover that the voter-once thought to be dead-had cast a ballot for a third candidate in the race 	1	2	2
The absentee ballot  which many believed would determine the race  was originally set aside by election officials in the belief that the woman was deceased 	1	1	1
The hushed courtroom erupted into laughter on Wednesday  according to the Hartford Courant  after weeks of suspense  courtroom drama and fierce debate ended and it was revealed that the vote would remain deadlocked and a new election would still be necessary 	1	3	2
Instead  McGee demanded a recount  according to Av Harris  spokesman for the Connecticut secretary of state 	2	1	2
The results of that count put Canty ahead by one vote  leading McGee to sue 	1	1	2
One ballot cast a vote for McGee  leading again to a tie 	1	1	1
"The second ballot was marked ""deceased"" and that was the one opened in court "	1	1	1
She opened the ballot in court  revealing a vote for Windsor Mayor Donald Trinks  who finished a distant third 	1	1	2
It is pretty ironic  said Harris  whose office certifies elections in the state 	2	1	2
"This could have been resolved three weeks after the election with a revote	2	1	2
156 deceased-conn-voter-found-alive-cant-break-tie-165052779--abc-news-politics Now  we're just doing it anyway  only two months later "	2	1	3
Judge Peck ordered a new election 	1	1	1
Officials say that vote will be held Oct  2  and only those voters who previously cast ballots will be allowed to participate 	1	1	1
The New Definition of the American Dream	1	2	1
The siren call of the American dream may not be as powerful as it once was  but we are still a nation of believers  new research shows 	2	2	2
In fact  fame and fortune have replaced faith and family as the linchpins of the American dream  a survey of more than 500 U S  adults over 18 discovered 	1	3	1
The survey was conducted by JWT  a marketing communications company 	1	1	1
While the dream is very much alive and attainable  achieving it is more of a challenge  the survey found 	1	3	2
Almost 7 in 10 respondents said the dream became harder to realize for middle-class people in the past five to 10 years  up from 4 in 10 in 2008 	1	1	2
The exceptionalism of the American dream is also being questioned by younger Americans 	2	1	1
While a majority of older generations believe the dream is unique  only 4 in 10 millennials hold that view 	1	2	2
While the dream is losing its luster  and Americans recognize that it's becoming significantly harder to achieve  the concept endures  7 in 10 still believe in the idea  not much fewer than in 2008  said Ann Mack  JWT's director of trendspotting 	2	2	2
Del  development finance panel meets	1	1	1
NEW CASTLE  Del  (AP) — State economic development officials are considering whether to approve a bond issue of up to $20 million for the Delaware Military Academy 	1	1	1

WASHINGTON (AP) — Clint Eastwood has taken a lot of barbs over his empty chair routine at the Republican National Convention  but Denzel Washington still holds the film legend in high regard 	2	2	2
"I have the utmost respect for him as an actor and as a director  Washington said  ""He's my hero """	2	3	1
I listen to both sides of the argument and try to make an assessment  he said 	2	2	1
Washington was in the nation's capital along with Olympic champion Michael Phelps and R&B singer Ashanti for an event sponsored by the Boys and Girls Club of America 	1	1	1
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank AG expects to see one-off costs in the third quarter linked to its job cuts  litigation expenses and the reduction of risk-weighted assets  Co-Chief Executive Anshu Jain told a financial conference 	1	1	1
Jain reiterated that Germany's largest bank had seen solid performance in the third quarter  particularly in investment banking 	1	2	1
On the revenue side we are in line  but we definitely have headwinds on the cost side  Jain told the conference in London  which was monitored over the Internet 	2	2	2
To free up equity capital  Deutsche plans to slash risk weighted assets by about 90 billion euros ($117 billion) by the end of the first quarter 2013 	1	1	1
Germany's flagship lender plans to cut more than 1 900 jobs  mainly in investment banking and is also battling law suits by investors and regulators 	1	1	3
Deutsche aims to save about 4 5 billion euros in costs by 2015 to steer against the loss of profitability and tougher international regulation of banks in the wake of the financial crisis 	1	2	2
Did cavemen have dentists?	1	1	1
Cavities can be excruciating  and new evidence suggests prehistoric man used a surprisingly sophisticated technique to deal with the pain: Dental fillings  A team of scientists in Italy have identified a 6 500-year-old cracked tooth repaired with beeswax  suggesting our early ancestors knew a thing or two about dental work  A closer look at the findings:	2	2	1
"What did researchers find?The study  outlined in the journal PLoS One  takes a look at a fossilized jaw bone discovered in Slovenia near Trieste  Of special interest was the left canine  which sported a large crack that ""exposed some of the inner enamel and tissues within the tooth called dentin "" says Brian Fung at The Atlantic  In other words: It probably caused a lot of pain "	2	1	2
"And it was repaired with beeswax?Yes  Infrared spectroscopy confirmed the ancient filling to be beeswax  while radiocarbon dating found that it was about 6 500 years old  In all likelihood  the procedure was done either shortly before or after the 24- to 30-year-old individual's death  The team could not rule out the possibility that the wax was ""added during a funerary ritual "" says Rossella Lorenzi at Discovery News  although evidence suggests it was added while the young man was still alive "	2	1	1
"Why do they think that?The severity of the crack has researchers believing the tooth was incredibly sensitive  and probably caused him a lot of discomfort  For example other teeth had exposed dentin yet no beeswax was applied  That means if the dental work was done when he was still alive  they write  ""the intervention was likely aimed to relieve tooth sensitivity derived from either exposed dentin    or the pain resulting from chewing on a cracked tooth "" Essentially  it's the oldest ""therapeutic-palliative dental filling"" found to date "	3	2	2
How did Mumford & Sons get bigger than Justin Bieber?	1	2	1
Watch out  Justin Bieber: Babel  the latest LP from the blandly inoffensive English folk rockers Mumford & Sons  is projected to sell as many as 600 000 copies this week — nearly twice as many as Bieber's latest CD  Believe  which has held the 2012 record since its release in June 	2	2	1
Over the past year  Mumford & Sons has earned a devoted following in the U S   but few would have predicted that their CD would outsell new albums by mega-artists like Green Day and Madonna — let alone dethrone the king of tween pop 	2	3	1
Why is this unassuming English folk band setting record-breaking sales?	2	2	1
Here  four theories:	1	1	1
1  Their digital sales are spectacularThe total LP sales are impressive  says Chris Martins at Spin  but there's another key part of the story: Digital sales are booming 	2	2	1
It's likely that Babel will earn the second-highest number of weekly sales for a digital album ever (behind Lady Gaga's Born This Way) 	1	2	1
"2  They've had an unusually savvy promotional tour""September has been kind to Mumford & Sons "" says The Huffington Post "	2	2	1
They've spent the weeks leading up to Babel's release doing what they do best: Performing live  including a one-hour show on Live on Letterman 	2	1	1
And their biggest recent appearance?	2	1	1
A high-profile gig on last weekend's Saturday Night Live  highlighting two well-received songs from the new album 	2	1	1
"3  They don't rely on singlesThe band may have broken through with ""Little Lion Man "" a single from their first album  but they've since been able to cultivate fans who ""want to hear their complete body of work "" says Melinda Newman at Hitfix "	1	1	1
Mumford & Sons has more in common with artists like Radiohead or Coldplay  who don't depend on Top 40 or radio support  than artists like Rihanna or Katy Perry  who have built their careers on radio-friendly singles 	1	1	1
"4  Their music is uplifting""Mumford & Sons is essentially Tim Tebow in an indie-rock context "" says Steven Hyden at Grantland "	2	2	1
"In both music and personality  frontman Marcus Mumford exudes a ""wholesome  inspirational"" warmth  with lyrics that dismiss cynicism and encourage hope "	3	2	1
"The band hits ""the sweet spot between the rustic introspection of Bon Iver and the rabble-rousing scrappiness of early Avett Brothers "" creating an inoffensive  accessible album that has plenty of mass appeal "	3	2	1
Disfigured Spain fresco rides global fame	1	2	1
You can even use it as an avatar in online games 	1	1	1
The church fresco of Christ in the town of Borja was for decades a little-known piece of religious art by a minor Spanish artist 	1	1	1
Now that it's been disfigured in a botched restoration attempt revealed a month ago  it has found a new fate as a global icon — used to sell products around the world 	1	2	1
And Cecilia Gimenez  the 80-year-old pensioner behind the disastrous touch-up  is exploring her intellectual property rights 	2	1	1
"The fresco depicts Christ with a crown of thorns before crucifixion  in a style style known as ""Ecce Homo"" (Behold the Man) "	1	1	1
The result was so awful that it could only be destined for one thing: worldwide fame 	3	2	2
"The solemn Ecce Homo quickly took on a less dignified identity  as ""Ecce Mono """	2	1	1
Behold the Monkey 	1	1	1
Gimenez has gone into hiding in her hometown of Borja  about a four-hour drive from Madrid  to avoid countless international media interview requests 	1	1	1
The town itself has morphed into a tourism destination for people who want to see her restoration 	1	1	1
The crush has been so big that the Santi Spiritus foundation that owns the Misercordia church and sanctuary recently started charging admission: one euro per visitor 	1	1	1
"Meanwhile  Internet entrepreneurs have quickly moved in to cash in on the phenomenon  printing ""Ecce Mono"" on a seemingly endless range of products to sell online "	1	2	1
Gimenez' lawyers say she has no interest in a cut of what the foundation is charging people to see the fresco 	1	1	1
But they are gearing up to put a stop to potential copyright violations of what she created — even though she had not set out to create anything at all 	1	1	1
We want to put some order to this anarchy  said Antonio Val Carreras Rivera  one of her lawyers 	3	2	2
"You do this little by little under legality  and our job is to coordinate to prevent third parties from profiting	3	1	1
163 disfigured-spain-fresco-rides-global-fame-161733145 We are at the beginning now  we can't say if she has rights "	2	1	1
If the lawyers determine she does  Gimenez could pursue payments from those using the image to sell products  Carreras Rivera said  adding that whatever she earns will go to charity 	2	2	1
While Gimenez' lawyers research her legal rights  the Sancti Spiritus foundation is stuck in its own legal bind about what to do with the fresco 	1	1	1
Should it restore the painting to its original state?	1	1	1
Or try  as experts say is possible  to separate the two?	1	1	1
Gimenez herself is thankful for the many messages of support she's received from around the world  her lawyers said in a statement 	1	2	1
Everyone wants to solve this  but no one knows the solution  Arilla said 	3	2	2
While Gimenez could end up with ownership of what she painted on top of the fresco  the foundation isn't sure who owns the original 	2	1	1
It's either the foundation or the 16 grandchildren of the painter 	1	1	1
This seems like it's going to be a long process  Arilla said 	2	1	1
Meanwhile  Borja is trying to cope with its newfound fame 	1	1	1
The influx of visitors hasn't shown any sign of letting up since news of the fresco rocketed around the world  Arrilla said 	1	1	1
About 1 000 people paid admission last weekend  and the number of visitors has averaged 100 daily this week 	1	2	1
The charge was put in place to cover the cost of additional workers needed at the sanctuary to manage the crowds 	1	1	1
"Disney film to show how ""Mary Poppins"" flew from book to screen"	1	2	1
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The tale of how the world's most beloved nanny  Mary Poppins  flew from the pages of a popular book onto the big screen is the subject of a new film starring Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson  Disney said on Wednesday 	2	3	2
"The film called ""Saving Mr  Banks"" began production on Wednesday "	1	1	1
"It tells of Walt Disney's 20-year pursuit of the film rights to author P L  Travers' novel ""Mary Poppins "" Walt Disney Co's movie studio said in a statement "	2	1	1
Thompson will play Travers  who reluctantly granted Disney the film rights while demanding script and character control that clashed with Disney's vision for the movie musical 	1	2	2
"Mary Poppins was released in 1964 and won five Oscars  including a best actress award for Julie Andrews in the title role  best original score and best song for ""Chim Chim Cher-ee """	2	4	1
The story of the magical English nanny who flies with her umbrella has also been made into a hit stage musical  playing on Broadway 	1	1	1
The Cameron Mackintosh production was also a hit in London's West End 	1	1	1
Saving Mr  Banks will be released sometime in 2013  Disney said 	2	1	1
Divided town challenges Myanmar's democracy hopes	2	1	2
SITTWE  Myanmar (AP) — There are no Muslim faithful in most of this crumbling town's main mosques anymore  no Muslim students at its university 	2	1	2
Three-and-a-half months after some of the bloodiest clashes in a generation between Myanmar's ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and stateless Muslims known as Rohingya left the western town of Sittwe in flames  nobody is quite sure when — or even if — the Rohingya will be allowed to resume the lives they once lived here 	2	1	4
The conflict has fundamentally altered the demographic landscape of this coastal state capital  giving way to a disturbing policy of government-backed segregation that contrasts starkly with the democratic reforms Myanmar's leadership has promised the world since half a century of military rule ended last year 	1	1	2
While the Rakhine can move freely  some 75 000 Rohingya have effectively been confined to a series of rural displaced camps outside Sittwe and a single downtown district they dare not leave for fear of being attacked 	1	1	3
For the town's Muslim population  it's a life of exclusion that's separate  and anything but equal 	1	1	2
We're living like prisoners here  said Thant Sin  a Rohingya shopkeeper who has been holed up since June in the last Rohingya-dominated quarter of central Sittwe that wasn't burned down 	2	1	3
Too afraid to leave  the 47-year-old cannot work anyway 	2	1	3
The blue wooden doors of his shuttered pharmaceutical stall sit abandoned inside the city's main market — a place only Rakhine are now allowed to enter 	1	1	2
The crisis in western Myanmar goes back decades and is rooted in a highly controversial dispute over where the region's Muslim inhabitants are really from 	1	1	2
Although many Rohingya have lived in Myanmar for generations  they are widely denigrated here as foreigners — intruders who came from neighboring Bangladesh to steal scarce land 	1	1	2
Human rights groups say racism also plays a role: Many Rohingya  who speak a distinct Bengali dialect and resemble Muslim Bangladeshis  have darker skin and are heavily discriminated against 	1	1	3
By mid-June  skirmishes between rival mobs carrying swords  spears and iron rods erupted across the region 	1	1	3
Conservative estimates put the death toll at around 100 statewide  with 5 000 homes burned along with dozens of mosques and monasteries 	1	1	4
Sittwe suffered more damage than most  and today blackened tracts of rubble-strewn land filled with knotted tree stumps are scattered everywhere 	1	1	3
The largest tract  called Narzi  once was home to 10 000 Muslims 	1	1	1
Human Rights Watch accused security forces of colluding with Rakhine mobs at the height of the mayhem  opening fire on Rohingya even as they struggled to douse the flames of their burning homes 	1	1	3
Speaking to a delegation of visiting American diplomats earlier this month  Border Affairs Minister Lt  Gen  Thein Htay described Sittwe's new status quo 	1	1	1
It's not what we want  he added with a polite smile 	2	1	1
But this is the reality we face 	2	1	1
While police and soldiers are protecting mosques and guarding Rohingya in camps  there is much they cannot control 	1	1	2
One group of 300 local Buddhist leaders  for example  issued pamphlets urging the Rakhine not to do business with the Rohingya or even talk to them 	1	1	2
Inside Sittwe's once mixed municipal hospital  a separate ward has been established to serve Muslim patients only  on a recent day  it was filled with just four patients whose families said they could only get there with police escorts 	1	1	2
At the town's university  only Rakhine now attend 	1	1	2
And at the main market  plastic identity cards are needed to enter: pink for shopkeepers  yellow for customers  none for Rohingya 	1	1	2
The crisis has posed one of the most serious challenges yet to Thein Sein's nascent government  which declared a state of emergency and warned the unrest could threaten the country's nascent transition toward democracy if it spread 	2	1	2
Although the clashes have been contained and an independent commission has been appointed to study the conflict and recommend solutions  the government has shown little political will to go further 	2	1	2
The Rohingya are a deeply unpopular cause in Myanmar  where even opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and former political prisoners imprisoned by the army have failed to speak out on their behalf 	2	1	2
In July  Thein Sein himself suggested the Rohingya should be sent to any other country willing to take them 	2	1	2
In that context  we're seeing them segregated into squalid camps  fleeing the country  and in some cases being rounded up and imprisoned  said Matthew Smith  a researcher for Human Rights Watch who authored a recent report for the New York-based group on the latest unrest 	2	1	2
"In places like Sittwe  ""there is a risk of permanent segregation "" Smith said "	2	1	2
None of this bodes well for the prospects of a multi-ethnic democracy 	2	1	3
In the meantime  the government's own statistics indicate the crisis is worsening — at least for the Rohingya 	1	1	3
While the total number of displaced Rakhine statewide has declined from about 24 000 at the start of the crisis to 5 600 today  the number of displaced Rohingya has risen from 52 000 to 70 000  mostly in camps just outside Sittwe 	1	1	3
The government has blamed the rise on Rohingya it says didn't lose homes but who are eager to gain access to aid handouts 	1	1	3
Insecurity is also likely a factor  though 	2	1	3
Amnesty International has accused authorities of detaining hundreds of Rohingya in a post-conflict crackdown aimed almost exclusively at Muslims 	1	1	3
And in August  3 500 people were displaced after new clashes saw nearly 600 homes burned in the town of Kyauktaw  according to the U N 	1	1	3
Elsewhere in Rakhine state  the army has resumed forced labor against Muslims  ordering villagers to cultivate the military's paddy fields  act as porters and rebuild destroyed homes  according to a report by the Arakan Project  an activist group 	1	1	3
In Sittwe  mutual fear and distrust runs so high that most of the 7 000 Rohingya crammed inside a dilapidated quarter called Aung Mingalar have not set foot outside it since June 	2	1	3
It's the last Muslim-inhabited block downtown  a tiny place that takes about five minutes to cross by foot 	1	1	1
There are no clinics  medical care or schools  and Thant Sin is worried his savings will run out in weeks 	1	1	2
The married father of five has been unable to open his market stall since authorities ordered it shut three months ago 	1	1	2
"One told him  ""This for the Rakhine now "" he recalled "	2	1	1
The government is doing nothing to help us get our lives back 	2	1	2
All four roads into Aung Mingalar are guarded by police  and outside  past the roadblocks of barbed wire and wood that divide the district from the rest of town  Rakhine walk freely — sometimes yelling racial slurs or hurling stones from slingshots 	1	1	3
Across the street  a 57-year-old Rakhine  Aye Myint  leaned back in a rusted metal chair and peered at a group of bearded Muslim men in Aung Mingalar 	1	1	1
Hla Thain  the attorney general of Rakhine state  denied there was any official policy of forced segregation  saying security forces are deployed to protect both sides  not keep them apart 	2	1	2
But he acknowledged that there were not enough police or soldiers to make the two communities feel safe  and that huge obstacles to reconciliation remain 	1	1	2
We want them to live together  that is our goal  but we can't force people to change  he said 	1	1	2
"Anger is still running high	2	1	3
165 divided-town-challenges-myanmars-democracy-hopes-015249546 Neither side can forget that they lost family members  their homes "	2	1	4

Does early voting damage democracy?	2	1	3
We won't find out who won the presidential race until Nov  6 (or later)  but the election has actually already started 	2	2	2
That means six weeks before Election Day  half the country can cast ballots — and skip the presidential debates  ignore unpredictable world events and hidden videos  and TiVO away the political ads 	3	1	3
This is a problem for many reasons  says Matt Lewis at The Daily Caller 	3	1	4
"Among them: Early voting is expensive for states and campaigns  sends voters to the polls prematurely  and most importantly  ""doesn't work """	3	1	3
"In fact  ""researchers at the University of Wisconsin demonstrated that early voting can actually depress turnout"" — largely by mitigating get-out-the-vote efforts  and diminishing the civic engagement attraction of Election Day "	2	1	3
Could the effort to expand voting opportunities actually be bad for democracy?	1	1	2
"Yes  Early voting is a ""travesty"": The first problem with early voting is that it isn't fair  says Ed Lasky at American Thinker "	3	1	4
"Letting people lock in their votes before the ""debates can enlighten voters "" ads can educate them  and bad jobs numbers can reflect poorly on the incumbent ""is a travesty """	3	1	4
Then there's the issue of fraud with absentee ballots 	3	1	3
"Yet sadly  ""few critics have pointed out how damaging early voting can be to our democracy """"The"	3	1	4
SEE MORE: The battle over voter ID laws	1	1	1
Huh? Early voting is good for democracy: Most of the opposition's reasons are nonsense  says Jazz Shaw at Hot Air 	2	3	2
"Absentee-ballot fraud is a myth  the cost issue is either the campaigns' problem or up to the voters of each state  and the study about early voting depressing turnout ""relies on torturing the data with so many vague and glossy 'variables'    that it becomes a very murky soup """	3	2	3
"Besides  as a general rule  opposing ""extended voting opportunities is an idea which immediately sets off alarms for me "" as it should for anyone who values participatory democracy ""Should"	3	2	2
Like it or not  early voting may kill Election Day: Early voting is gaining ground — and that's kind of sad for civic engagement  University of Wisconsin political scientist Barry Burden tells the AP 	3	1	4
"Election Day was a community and media event  and it was ""hard to miss """	3	2	2
"If early voting eventually relegates the first Tuesday in November to the nostalgia bin  many ""people who are on the edge of voting"" probably won't cross the finish line ""Vote"	2	1	2

Does looking at pictures of puppies improve concentration?	1	2	1
Here's a quick guide to the aww-inducing news:	1	1	1
Wait  a study about cute photos?Yes  a team of scientists from Hiroshima University wanted to revisit and improve on a previous experiment which found that people who looked at cute images behaved more carefully — an ingrained response that has to do with an instinctual need to handle babies safely 	3	2	1
Building on this  scientists divided 132 university students into three groups and had them perform separate tasks 	1	1	1
"The first group played a game similar to ""Operation"" (the board game that challenges you to remove ""body parts"" from a graphic representation of a body using tweezers  buzzing when you make an error) "	1	1	1
The second group was asked to find a given number in a random sequence of numbers 	1	1	1
The third group took a test designed to measure their level of focus 	1	1	1
The members of each group completed one round of their respective tasks  at that point  half were shown images of baby animals while the other half were shown photos of adult animals 	1	1	1
What did researchers find?In all three experiments  participants who looked at pictures of cute baby animals outperformed those who looked at pictures of adult animals (as well as images of neutral objects) 	2	2	1
"In the ""Operation"" experiment  performance scores among those participants who'd viewed the cute photos improved by 44 percent "	1	2	1
In the numbers game  such participants were more accurate  improving their scores by about 16 percent 	1	2	1
"Researchers concluded that ""viewing cute images makes participants behave more deliberately and perform tasks with greater time and care """	1	2	1
How can we use puppy photos to our advantage?The study's authors suggest that incorporating such cute imagery into our everyday professional routines could make people more careful and deliberate in their work 	2	2	1
Bosses  however  may need a little convincing 	2	1	1
Most parents are anxious to steer their kids away from drug and alcohol abuse  But what's the best way to do it? A new study by public health analyst Christine Jackson of the research institute RTI International  along with colleagues at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  found that an unexpectedly high number of mom and dads think they can avoid raising kids who become irresponsible drinkers by exposing them to small amounts of alcohol — a sip of beer  a little wine — at a young age  Is that really a good idea? Here  a brief guide:	2	2	2
"How many parents believe in introducing their kids to booze in tiny increments?Jackson and her fellow researchers surveyed 1 000 mothers and their third-grade children in North Carolina  South Carolina  and Tennessee  and found that 40 percent of moms believed that forbidding alcohol would only make their kids more rebellious  One-fifth of the moms believed the occasional sip of wine or beer at dinner would ""help inoculate young kids against the lurking dangers of peer pressure "" says Doug Barry at Jezebel  making them less drawn to experimenting with risky  heavy drinking in their teen years "	2	2	3
Are these parents actually giving their young kids booze?Many are  according to Jackson  One-third of the third graders the study examined had already tried beer  wine  or  in some cases  even hard liquor  The study suggests that their parents — at least  those who know about the drinking — think the kids will take the responsible drinking habits they learn at home  under mom and dad's watchful eyes  out into the world  Not so fast  health experts warn 	2	2	3
"What does early drinking really do to kids?Numerous studies over the last several years have found that ""early-onset"" drinking is a ""known primary risk factor for problem drinking during adolescence "" the researchers write  And remember  teenage brains have underdeveloped ""brakes "" making teens more likely to mimic their peers' dangerous behavior when partying  rather than the moderate drinking styles of parents at the dinner table "	1	1	3
"So what's a mom or dad to do?""Try and delay exposure to alcohol for as long as possible "" says Ralph Hingson  director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's Division of Epidemiology and Prevention Research  Jackson says even a few sips could be enough to put a kid at risk  although some health experts aren't so sure  The most important factor is ""the age at which kids first get drunk "" says Tim Stockwell  director of Canada's Center for Addictions Research of British Columbia  ""That predicted far more than the age at which they first had a drink and I'm thinking that would apply to a sip  All the worries about alcohol are not about sipping """	1	1	3
Dog quickly takes in  nurses stray kitten in Minn 	1	1	1
JORDAN  Minn 	1	1	1
(AP) — A Minnesota woman says she was shocked when her small dog began caring for an abandoned kitten  then started producing milk and nursing the fuzzy gray stray to health 	2	1	2
Pat Weber says the kitten was days old when her grandson found it in the family's barn in early September in Jordan  about 40 miles southwest of Minneapolis 	1	1	1
"She says the 2-inch-long kitten was ""ice cold """	2	1	2
But she felt it move  so she wrapped the kitten in a warm towel 	2	1	1
The tawny pooch named Mittens began licking the kitten  who nuzzled in and began suckling 	2	1	1
Mittens hadn't had puppies in two years  yet she eventually began producing milk 	1	1	1
She's been nursing the kitten ever since 	1	1	1
Weber calls it a miracle 	2	2	1
Dog survives ride in car's grille from Mass  to RI	1	2	2

Dolan says Dish had been happy with Voom HD channels	2	2	1
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cablevision Systems Corp founder Charles Dolan testified on Monday that it was ""quite a reversal"" when Dish Network Corp abruptly ended their contract for high-definition programming  a dispute at the center of a long-running legal feud between the two pay TV providers "	3	1	3
Dolan  Cablevision's billionaire chairman  was the first witness in the trial in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan 	1	1	1
Voom HD  a former Cablevision unit  sued Dish in 2008  saying Dish violated a 15-year deal to carry HD programming and should pay $2 4 billion in damages 	3	1	3
Dish has countered that Cablevision did not invest the $100 million per year in the service it had promised 	3	1	3
Voom HD is now a part of AMC Networks  which Cablevision spun out last year 	1	1	1
"Dish blocked AMC  the company behind critically acclaimed shows such as ""Mad Men"" and ""Breaking Bad "" as well as the IFC  WE and Sundance channels from its 14 million customers in July "	1	2	2
Media analysts say the trial's outcome could decide whether Dish ever carries the channels again 	3	2	2
Dolan's son  James  who is Cablevision's chief executive and the owner of the New York Knicks basketball team  had also been expected to testify  but a source close to the case who declined to be identified said on Monday he likely will not take the stand 	3	1	1
Dolan  who turns 86 this month and rarely speaks in public  testified that he was not aware of Dish being anything less than satisfied with Cablevision's Voom HD programming package 	2	2	1
Dolan said it was known that Ergen dislikes rock music so this did not surprise anyone at Cablevision 	3	2	2
In all of his meetings with Ergen  Dolan said the Dish executive was always upbeat and optimistic the HD channels would be successful and Dish even took a 20 percent stake in the venture 	3	4	1
"We had repeated meetings     Definitely  (Ergen) was interested	3	3	1
171 dolan-says-dish-had-happy-voom-hd-channels-203639641--finance He appreciated the programming  Dolan said "	3	3	1
Dolan also testified that it had been his idea for Cablevision to invest $100 million per year  or half a billion dollars over five years  in Voom HD 	2	2	1
A key question for the jury will be whether Cablevision spent $100 million a year on the service 	2	1	1
Cablevision said that it spent more than $100 million per year on the service  including marketing and overhead costs  as it promised 	3	2	2
Dolan said Dish broke its 15-year contract with Voom HD to pay it $3 25 per subscriber for the channels in 2008  around the same time that other popular networks such as ESPN began offering HD feeds for free 	3	1	3
"This made Cablevision ""cynical"" about Dish's motives in ending the contract  Dolan said "	3	1	3
Charlie was realizing he could sell (HD channels) without paying us  Dolan said  referring to Ergen 	3	1	3

Dozens injured  20 arrested when massive riot erupts at Foxconn plant [video]	1	1	3
Approximately 40 people were injured and 20 were arrested when a massive riot broke out Sunday at Foxconn’s (2038) Taiyuan plant in Northern China 	1	1	3
Details are still conflicting  however early reports from Engadget suggest the incident began after a security guard struck a worker during anti-Japan protests at around 10:00 p m  local time on Sunday 	2	1	2
The plant  which manufactures magnesium alloy components and LED lighting products  has been closed following the incident 	1	1	2
Foxconn issued a preliminary statement suggesting the incident was triggered by “a fight among workers from different production lines ” but the company noted it is “still investigating the cause of the fight and the number of people involved ”	1	1	2
BERLIN (Reuters) - The head of the European Central Bank  Mario Draghi  will discuss the state of economic and currency union in the euro zone with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin next Tuesday  a senior German source said on Wednesday 	2	1	1
The source  speaking on condition of anonymity  said Joerg Asmussen  Germany's executive board member at the ECB  would join the talks from the bank's side 	3	1	1
Draghi is also due to address Germany's main industry group BDI the same day 	2	1	1

The budget committee of Germany's lower house of parliament  the Bundestag  has invited him to do so  though no date has yet been announced 	1	1	1
The ECB's plans for potentially unlimited purchases of debt issued by troubled euro zone countries have stirred deep unease in Germany  where some see them as violating a taboo on the central bank financing state budgets and also fear they will fan inflation 	3	1	3
Dredd 3D: A movie remake that's actually better than the original?	2	2	1
Film critics have begun to judge Dredd 3D  a new take on the popular comic book character (view trailer below) that hits theaters today — and the verdict is surprisingly positive  given the scathing reviews and relatively meager box office elicited by 1995's Judge Dredd  starring Sylvester Stallone 	3	2	1
While Sly's version claims a paltry 15 percent of positive reviews on aggregator Rotten Tomatoes  Dredd 3D's approval rating currently sits at a strong 77 percent 	2	1	1
With Dredd 3D  starring Karl Urban  has Hollywood actually managed to produce a remake that surpasses the original?	2	2	1
"Finally  Hollywood has done justice to Judge Dredd: This is the ""grim and gritty and violent"" take on Judge Dredd that comic-book fans have been waiting for  says Edward Douglas at ComingSoon net "	2	1	1
"Dredd 3D"""	1	1	1
"Stallone's Judge Dredd was bad — but it's still better than Dredd 3D: ""Say what you will about Sylvester Stallone's kitschy"" performance in 1995's Judge Dredd  says Roger Moore at the Detroit Free Press  at least Stallone ""wore the helmet"" — in Dredd 3D  ""the helmet wears Karl """	2	2	2
"Stallone's foray into the world of Judge Dredd was flawed  but at least it had personality  this ""mega-violent satire"" only manages to be ""mega-boring """"As"	2	1	2
"Judge Dredd  Karl Urban is all helmet  no charisma"""	2	1	2
"Dredd 3D is ""a far grittier and more capable rendering"" of the character than ""the really disastrous Sylvester Stallone-starring mangling of the comic"" — but its collection of ""post-modern sci-fi cliches"" feels dated after the 17 years of science-fiction that has been released in Judge Dredd's wake "	2	2	2
"It's not ""a bad movie version of Judge Dredd "" but considering the leaps and bounds by which the genre has grown  it's simply ""too little too late """"Dredd"	2	1	2

Earth-Sun Distance Measurement Redefined	1	1	1
One of the stalwart units of astronomy just got a makeover 	2	2	1
The International Astronomical Union  the authority on astronomical constants  has voted unanimously to redefine the astronomical unit  the conventional unit of length based on the distance between the Earth and the sun 	1	1	1
The new definition is much simpler than the old one  says Sergei Klioner of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany  one of a group of scientists who worked decades toward the change  which took effect last month during an IAU meeting	3	2	1
Under the new definition  the astronomical unit (or AU) — the measurement used for the Earth-sun distance — is no longer always in flux  depending on the length of a day and other changing factors 	2	2	1
It is now a fixed number: 149 597 870 700 meters  which is the equivalent of almost 92 956 million miles 	1	1	1
They utilize the astronomical unit to calculate the motion of bodies in the solar system 	1	1	1
The broader community of astronomers are able now to better  with less efforts  understand what their colleagues — astronomers who are experts in planetary ephemerides — do and how they produce the high-accuracy theories of motion in the solar system  he told SPACE com by email 	3	3	1
The revision also makes the unit easier for engineers  software designers and students to understand  Klioner and his colleague Nicole Capitaine  of Paris Observatory  noted 	3	2	1
At the same time  the redefinition can serves an epitaph to the bygone era when Earth-bound scientists depended on viewing angles to calculate celestial distances 	2	2	1
An established unit	1	1	1
Lacking precise instrumentation  early astronomers relied heavily on angles to calculate the size of the universe 	1	1	2
By studying Mars from two separate points on Earth  17th-century Italian astronomer Giovanni Cassini was able to use trigonometry to calculate the distance from Earth to the sun with only about a 6 percent error 	2	2	2
Such a practice was useful for many years  because astronomers were not able to make distance measurements in the solar system as precisely as they could measure angles 	3	2	1
Modern instruments can come within a few meters of exactly determining distances of over 150 million meters  or some 93 000 miles 	1	1	1
The astronomical unit eventually came to be defined by a mathematical expression that involved the mass of the sun  the length of a day  and a fixed number known as the Gaussian gravitational constant 	1	1	1
Because the Earth orbits its star in an ellipse rather than a circle  the length of a day shifts over the course of a year 	1	1	1
At the same time  the sun is constantly transforming mass into energy 	1	1	1
In the 20th century  famed scientist Albert Einstein added general relativity to the mix 	2	3	1
According to the famous theory  space-time is relative depending on one's frame of reference 	2	3	1
The new fixed number is the best estimate of the original expression  Klioner said 	2	2	1
A better way was to change the definition completely — and this is what we succeeded in doing 	3	3	1
"Capitaine said  ""The change of definition of the astronomical unit mainly concerns those in the field of high-accuracy solar system dynamics """	3	2	1
Satellites and other crafts traveling in space are not affected  because they rely on set distances 	1	1	1
The distance between the Earth and the sun  as any physical distance  should be measured and cannot be fixed by any sort of resolution  Klioner said 	3	2	1
The times  they are a-changing	1	1	1
Capitaine and Klioner are among several scientists who worked over the last two decades on a revision of the astronomical unit 	2	1	1
Capitaine said she first got involved when she gave a presentation in 1994 with Bernard Guinot  also of Paris Observatory 	2	1	1
The resolution was reworked several times before it won unanimous passage 	1	1	1
The change as we have it now is really a product of collective work  Klioner said 	2	2	1

Shifting from a constantly changing value to a fixed number may seem like an easy choice  but the group faced some resistance 	2	2	1
Some believed that the overhaul would be too difficult to implement with crucial software  while others were concerned that discrepancies might be introduced into past work 	2	1	2
Still others were uncomfortable changing such a historic definition 	2	1	2

Easing German inflation still above ECB target	1	1	1
BERLIN (Reuters) - Inflation in the euro zone's largest economy of Germany slowed in September  but not by enough to support the case for a recession-fighting interest rate cut by the European Central Bank 	2	1	1
Preliminary data showed annual inflation slowed to two percent on seasonal factors such as reduced food and travel costs  matching a Reuters consensus forecast 	1	2	1
The measure fell from 2 1 percent in August when it jumped on energy prices 	1	1	1
The European Central Bank aims to keep inflation close to  but just under  2 percent in the euro zone as a whole 	1	1	1
Over the past two to three months  there has not been a trend of price easing in Germany which would catch anybody's attention and influence the debate at the ECB over rates  said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg Bank 	2	1	2
For much of last year Germany's inflation rate remained above 2 0 percent  as its economy outperformed that of its peers  fuelling robust wage rises across many sectors 	2	3	1
But economists said inflation  which regained momentum in August after briefly dipping below the 2 percent mark in the summer  looked unlikely to ease sustainably any time soon 	2	2	2
Energy and food prices  as well as the ECB's policies and a pickup in the economy  all risked fuelling price pressures 	1	1	1
Meanwhile  food prices have risen after the worst drought in half a century in the United States and poor crops from the Black Sea bread basket hit corn  wheat and soybean supplies 	1	1	3
Berlin and the Bundesbank have hinted they would tolerate higher prices as long as euro-wide inflation remains under control 	1	1	1
That could help ailing euro zone countries boost their competitiveness 	1	2	1
But a Reuters poll of 41 economists shows data due to be released on Friday will likely show euro zone prices rose 2 5 percent in September 	1	1	1
On a monthly basis  German consumer prices were unchanged in September  according to the preliminary data from the Federal Statistics Office 	1	1	1
Consumer prices harmonized to compare with other European Union countries were unchanged on the month and rose 2 1 percent on the year  down from 2 2 percent in August 	1	1	1
The Statistics Office's preliminary inflation calculations are based on data contributed by six German states 	1	1	1
Final German price data for September are due to be released on October 11  the office said 	1	1	1
Inflation had only accelerated in one of the six states  in Baden-Wuerttemberg  for the most part slowing on lower food and travel costs 	1	1	1
LOS ANGELES (TheWrap com)	1	1	1
"- Ed Zwick (""The Last Samurai"") has fallen off directing duties for the historic epic ""The Great Wall "" an individual close to the project told to TheWrap on Monday  adding that there was a difference in visions on how to move forward on the project between Zwick and the producers  Legendary East "	3	1	2
Legendary East is pushing ahead with the project  however  and seeking a new director to replace Zwick 	2	1	1
A decision was made earlier this summer to push the start date of the project from the fall to the spring to avoid adverse weather conditions  and there was some speculation about the future of the project 	1	1	1
But financing remains in place for the film  the individual said  and it is moving forward 	1	1	1
Earlier this year  casting was announced  with a starring lineup that included Henry Cavill and Benjamin Walker 	1	1	1
Chinese stars such as Zhang Ziyi are also reportedly being courted for the film 	1	1	1
The first film for Legendary East  the film is set in 15th century China and follows a group of British warriors who happen upon the wall as it is under construction 	1	1	1
They soon begin to realize that there is more to it than meets the eye 	2	1	1
The Great Wall was announced as the first film for Legendary East  a stand-alone company  which is based in Hong Kong and staffed with Chinese employees 	1	1	1
"At the end of last year  Legendary East terminated a distribution agreement with the Chinese group  the Huayi Brothers  which was due to distribute ""The Great Wall"" in China "	1	1	1
"Earlier this summer  Zwick signed on to direct the chess-master drama ""Pawn Sacrifice"" with Tobey Maguire "	1	1	1
Eddie Haskell Brooks	1	1	1
New York Times columnist David Brooks is the Eddie Haskell of the Fourth Estate 	1	1	1
"Like the two-faced sycophant in ""Leave It to Beaver "" Brooks indulges in excessive politeness while currying favor with political authority "	2	2	1
He prides himself on an oily semblance of maturity and rational discourse 	3	1	1
"But the phony ""conservative"" back-stabber  who has spent the last four years slavering over Barack Obama like a One Direction groupie and trashing the tea party like an MSNBC junkie  isn't fooling anyone "	4	1	1
"His column this week titled ""Thurston Howell Romney"" called Romney ""a kind  decent man"" — and then shredded him to pieces as a ""country club"" elitist who ""doesn't know much about the culture of America "" ""knows nothing about ambition and motivation "" and is ""running a depressingly inept presidential campaign """	4	2	3
"Eddie Haskell Brooks  along with fellow GOP bubble-dwellers Peggy Noonan and Bill Kristol  eagerly piled on Romney over his ""secret video"" remarks contrasting the nation's makers and takers "	3	1	1
"Liberal outlets embraced these chin-pulling tools — elevating them as ""key"" Republican voices who speak for the right "	3	2	1
Despite the best efforts of the Democratic-professional media complex to gin up faux-rage over Romney's remarks  however  several polls show that voters agree with Romney's fundamental critique of the indulgent Democratic politics of victimhood  identity and dependency 	3	2	2
Yep  Brooks has the pulse of mainstream America — direct from his hallowed bubble at the Fishwrap of Record 	4	1	1
"Brooks shares all he knows about ""ambition "" ""motivation"" and the ""culture of America"" through regular appearances with the insular clique of conservative-bashing snobs at taxpayer-supported ""PBS NewsHour """	2	2	2
A cursory glance at Brooks' biography shows that he has spent the majority of his life in New York City and Washington  D C 	2	1	1
He has worked for a raft of employers from The Washington Times to The Wall Street Journal to The Weekly Standard to The New York Times 	2	1	1
But unlike Romney  Brooks has never actually run a business of his own  managed a massive private entity  governed a state or overseen a campaign for national office 	3	1	1
He does have quite an impressive record  though 	3	2	1
"If by record you mean sucking up to empty suit Barack Obama  mocking grass-roots conservatives as ""teens"" and defending his cocktail party mates in establishment journalism "	4	1	2
"In 2009  the liberal New Republic published the bodice-ripping ""story behind the Obama-Brooks bromance """	2	1	1
"The magazine reported that ""two days after Obama's 'The Audacity of Hope' hit bookstores (in 2006)  Brooks published a glowing Times column "	2	1	1
"The headline was 'Run  Barack  Run '"""	1	1	1
Brooks also recounted his first encounter with his Democratic crush 	2	2	1
The purported conservative columnist's public display of affection for the radical Democratic candidate bordered on obscene 	4	1	2
I think he's more talented than anyone in my lifetime  Brooks gushed 	3	2	1
I mean  he is pretty dazzling when he walks into a room 	4	2	1
"Brooks revealed that he considered Obama's Chicago campaign mastermind David Axelrod a ""hero """	3	2	1
"Axelrod returned the love  calling Brooks a ""serious public thinker"" in an era of ""insipid  instant commentary and one-hour news cycles """	3	2	1
"In the fall of 2008  Brooks swooned over Obama's Ivy League ""achievatrons"" taking over Washington: ""Already the culture of the Obama administration is coming into focus "	3	1	1
Its members are twice as smart as the poor reporters who have to cover them  three times if you include the columnists 	4	1	1
"They typically served in the Clinton administration and then  like Cincinnatus  retreated to the comforts of private life — that is  if Cincinnatus had worked at Goldman Sachs  Williams & Connolly or the Brookings Institution """	2	1	1
Wait  he wasn't not done:	3	1	1

Egypt: 3 sentenced for 'morality' killing	1	1	3
CAIRO (AP) — An Egyptian court has convicted three Islamists of killing a student this summer as he sat in a quiet park with his fiancée  sentencing them to 15 years in prison in a case that sparked fears of vigilantes trying to enforce strict religious mores 	2	1	4
The state-owned Middle East News Agency said the Tuesday verdict was read out in a heavily-guarded courtroom in the Red Sea city of Suez  where 20-year-old Ahmed Hussein Eid was killed in June 	2	1	4
According to security officials at the time  three bearded men argued with Eid for loitering in the park with a woman who was not his wife 	3	1	3
One fatally stabbed him 	1	1	4
Many in Egypt fear that the rising political power of ultraconservative Islamists will see them flexing their muscles on the streets as well 	2	1	4
CAIRO (AP) — The owner of a TV station on trial for incitement after calling for the killing of Egypt's Islamist president Mohammed Morsi was arrested on Sunday in connection with a series of allegations  including theft of electrical power and issuing a bounced check  police said 	1	1	4
Tawfiq Okasha was not at his Cairo home when police went to arrest him  but he later surrendered at a police station in the eastern suburb of Nasr City  they added 	1	1	2
Also Sunday  Justice Ministry officials said an investigating judge referred the last prime minister of Egypt's deposed authoritarian leader Hosni Mubarak to trial on corruption charges arising from the decade he served as civil aviation minister  Besides Ahmed Shafiq  the chairman of national carrier EgyptAir and nine other ministry officials were also referred to trial 	2	1	3
Shafiq left Egypt shortly after his narrow defeat by Morsi in a presidential runoff in June  He has already been referred to trial on separate corruption charges dating back to the 1990s when he chaired a housing association for air force officers  Mubarak's two sons  onetime heir apparent Gamal and wealthy businessman Alaa  were charged in the same case together with four retired generals 	2	1	2
Shafiq  who lives in the United Arab Emirates  was defiant in a comment he posted on his Twitter account after news of his new trial broke in Cairo 	1	1	2
"I will continue my political work and I will stand up to persecution and the use of law to commit character assassination against me  he wrote  ""I traveled after the election to avoid expected persecution  Time has shown that it did happen "" wrote Shafiq  who like Mubarak is a career air force officer  He was named prime minister in Mubarak's final days in office "	3	1	3
"For months  he appeared on Al-Faraeen every night to mock the country's ""enemies"" — everyone from leftists and Islamists to Freemasons and Zionists — with rants full of abuse and earthy humor  In the weeks before a court ordered his station closed  he presented himself as Egypt's champion against a takeover by the Brotherhood  starting an open clash with the group and the new president "	3	2	3
No details were immediately available on the particulars of the charges 	1	1	2
The police and Justice Ministry officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters 	1	1	1
"The editor of the el-Dustour newspaper  which vilifies Morsi daily  is on trial for ""spreading lies"" and fabricating news  A Christian man is also serving a two-year prison sentence for insulting Morsi "	4	1	4
There are widespread worries among Egyptians that Morsi and the Brotherhood have amassed too much power  holding executive and legislative authorities as well as dominating the process of writing the next constitution 	3	1	2
But Okasha does not get much sympathy because many of the nation's key political players see him as a divisive figure  Many secular politicians and activists who distrust the Brotherhood shun him  seeing him as a remnant of Mubarak's authoritarian regime 	2	1	2
Veteran politician Ayman Nour was jailed on forgery charges soon after he finished a distant second in a 2005 presidential election  the only vote where Mubarak allowed someone besides himself to appear on the ballot  Shortly afterward  the politician who finished third lost the leadership of his party in a power struggle suspected to have been engineered by Mubarak's security agents 	1	1	3
Egypt's Morsi assumes major role in Mideast	1	1	1
In a wide-ranging address that touched on all major issues confronting the region  Morsi also decried Israeli settlement-building on territory Palestinians claim for a future state and condemned a film produced in the United States that denigrates Islam's Prophet Muhammad 	4	2	4
"He urged all U N  member nations to join in an effort to end what he called ""the catastrophe in Syria"" that pits the regime of Bashar Assad against opposition forces trying to end 40 years of dictatorship "	3	1	4
More than 30 000 people have been killed in the 18-month conflict 	1	1	5
"Morsi has called for Assad to step down and said Wednesday that ""the bloodshed in Syria and the humanitarian crisis that has unfolded must be stopped """	3	1	4
He then quickly inserted himself into the thorniest issues in the Middle East  demanding that the United Nations grant membership to the Palestinians  with or without a peace agreement with Israel 	3	2	2
"The fruits of dignity and freedom must not remain far from the Palestinian people  he said  adding that it was ""shameful"" that U N  resolutions are not enforced "	3	1	4
The Palestinians are expected to again ask for U N  recognition and formally make application to the world body in November  after the U S  presidential election 	1	1	1
The focus of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations  which have been on hold for four years  is a two-state solution that would formally grant the Palestinians the rights of an independent country 	1	2	1
In his bid to end the violence in Syria  Morsi has invited Turkey  Iran and Saudi Arabia to join a contact group  though the Saudis have not yet participated and the fighting in Syria continues unabated 	1	2	3
While Morsi wants Assad to step aside  he said Wednesday that he opposes any foreign military intervention 	2	1	1
Morsi also denounced as an obscenity the anti-Islam video that portrays the Prophet Muhammad as a womanizer  a child molester and a fraud  insisting that freedom of expression does not allow for attacks on any religion 	3	1	3
He also condemned the violence that swept Muslim countries last week in reaction to the video 	3	1	3
At least 51 people were killed  including the U S  ambassador to Libya and three other Americans targeted in an attack on the U S  Consulate in Benghazi 	1	1	3
He appeared to have been responding to Obama's General Assembly speech Tuesday in which the U S  leader again condemned the video but sternly defended the U S  Constitution's free speech guarantees 	3	1	1
In Cairo  Egyptians watched Morsi's speech closely for signs of how he would conduct his presidency 	2	1	1
Abdel-Mohsen  a 31-year architect  praised Morsi's condemnation of the Assad regime  but questioned his assertions about free speech 	3	2	2
Nabil Elaraby's comments to a special session of the U N  Security Council put him at direct odds with the United States and its Western allies  which are resolutely opposed to restrictions on freedom of expression 	2	3	2
"However  Elaraby said that if the West has criminalized acts that result in bodily harm  it must also criminalize acts that cause ""psychological and spiritual harm """	3	2	2
"Earlier Wednesday  Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  known for past fiery denunciations of the United States and Israel  spoke at length about his vision for a new world order without the ""hegemony of arrogance """	4	1	4
"Of Israel  he cited what he termed the ""continued threat by the uncivilized Zionists to resort to military action against our great nation """	4	2	4
"The U S  delegation boycotted Ahmadinejad's speech in response to the ""paranoid theories and repulsive slurs against Israel"" included in a separate address delivered by the Iranian president on Monday "	2	1	3
Thousands of protesters in yellow vests emblazoned with photos of Iranian dissidents they said were killed by the Iranian regime gathered outside U N  headquarters during the Iranian leader's speech 	2	1	4
Speakers included former House Speaker Newt Gingrich  Rep  Carolyn Maloney  D-NY  and former Rep  Patrick Kennedy  D-R I 	1	1	1
In his speech on Wednesday  Ahmadinejad did not refer to Iran's nuclear program 	1	1	2
Israel and Western nations contend that Tehran is using what it insists is a peaceful nuclear program as a cover for developing the ability to build atomic weapons 	2	2	3
Tough sanctions have been imposed on Iran as punishment for its failure to cooperate with the U N  nuclear watchdog agency to prove the peaceful nature of its drive to enrich uranium to levels that could be used to build a nuclear weapon 	2	1	3
He has vowed  however  to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear arsenal 	2	3	2

Egypt's Mursi appoints intelligence chief	1	1	1
CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt President Mohamed Mursi appointed a new national intelligence chief on Wednesday to replace Mourad Mwafi  who was sent into retirement after an attack that left 16 border guards dead in Sinai last month 	1	1	2
Mohamed Shehata  already named as Mwafi's temporary replacement following the August 5 attack  was given the post on a permanent basis  the president said in a statement 	1	1	1
Mursi's election win ended more than a year of interim army rule that followed the overthrow of president and former air force commander Hosni Mubarak 	1	1	1

Einstein's brain is now interactive iPad app	1	1	1
CHICAGO (AP) -- The brain that revolutionized physics now can be downloaded as an app for $9 99  But it won't help you win at Angry Birds 	1	2	2
While Albert Einstein's genius isn't included  an exclusive iPad application launched Tuesday promises to make detailed images of his brain more accessible to scientists than ever before  Teachers  students and anyone who's curious also can get a look 	2	2	1
A medical museum under development in Chicago obtained funding to scan and digitize nearly 350 fragile and priceless slides made from slices of Einstein's brain after his death in 1955  The application will allow researchers and novices to peer into the eccentric Nobel winner's brain as if they were looking through a microscope 	3	3	1
"I can't wait to find out what they'll discover  said Steve Landers  a consultant for the National Museum of Health and Medicine Chicago who designed the app  ""I'd like to think Einstein would have been excited """	2	3	1
After Einstein died  a pathologist named Thomas Harvey performed an autopsy  removing the great man's brain in hopes that future researchers could discover the secrets behind his genius 	1	3	2
Harvey gave samples to researchers and collaborated on a 1999 study published in the Lancet  That study showed a region of Einstein's brain — the parietal lobe — was 15 percent wider than normal  The parietal lobe is important to the understanding of math  language and spatial relationships 	1	2	1
The new iPad app may allow researchers to dig even deeper by looking for brain regions where the neurons are more densely connected than normal  said Dr  Phillip Epstein  a Chicago-area neuroscientist and consultant for the museum 	1	2	1
They didn't have MRI  We don't have a three-dimensional model of the brain of Einstein  so we don't know where the samples were taken from  said researcher Jacopo Annese of the Brain Observatory at the University of California  San Diego  What's more  the 1-inch-by-3-inch Einstein slides on the app represent only a fraction of the entire brain  Annese said 	1	1	1
A searchable website with images of more than 2 400 slides of Molaison's entire brain will be available to the public in December  Annese said 	1	1	1
It's a beautiful collection to have opened up to the public  Annese said 	3	2	1
Some may question whether Einstein would have wanted images of his remains sold to non-scientists for $9 99 	2	1	2
"There's been a lot of debate over what Einstein's intentions were  museum board member Jim Paglia said  ""We know he didn't want a circus made of his remains  But he understood the value to research and science to study his brain  and we think we've addressed that in a respectful manner """	2	2	1
"Paglia said the app could ""inspire a whole new generation of neuroscientists """	3	3	1
Electrons' Elusive Hideouts Imaged for First Time	1	1	1
For the first time  scientists have peered down to the level of a single electron and observed quantum states that had only been theorized before 	1	2	1
Researchers imaged the magnetic orbits of electrons called Landau levels  which were predicted in 1930 by Nobel Prize winner Lev Landau 	1	2	1
These orbits represent the curved paths electrons travel when exposed to very strong magnetic fields 	1	1	1
Previously  scientists had confirmed the levels exist by measuring the changes in electric current that result when electrons switch from one Landau level to another 	1	1	1
We are the first to have actually done what's called scanning tunneling microscopy and really look at individual states  said physicist Rudolf Roemer of England's University of Warwick 	2	2	1
Tinier circles	1	1	1
When charged particles  such as electrons  are put inside a magnetic field  they travel along curved paths  ultimately making a circle 	1	1	1
As the magnetic field gets stronger and stronger  these circles get smaller and smaller 	1	1	1
The smallest possible circles for the electrons to travel in are the Landau levels 	1	1	1
To image these levels  the physicists looked at electrons on the surface of a semiconductor material 	1	1	1
Then they used scanning tunneling spectroscopy to look for the possible locations of electrons 	1	1	1
This technique images a sample by allowing electrons to try to pass into it at different locations 	1	1	1
If the location contains a feasible state for an electron  the particle will be able to jump into that state through a process called tunneling  confirming that it exists  if the location does not hold a potential electron state  there's nowhere for the electron to tunnel into 	1	1	1
In the resulting image  light areas represent the locations of possible states  while black spots show the lack of electron states 	1	1	1
The pictures produced byHashimoto and his team look remarkably like theoretical simulations predicted they would 	1	2	1
The agreement is even quantitatively so good 	3	3	1
Such images were never possible to make before because scanning tunneling spectroscopy has never been so advanced 	1	2	1
You really have to have a very good experimental setup  and you have to have lots of time  he said 	3	2	1
Redefining the kilogram	1	1	1
They could be put into practical use to help redefine the kilogram  the fundamental unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI) 	1	1	1
While most SI units are defined by relations between fundamental constants that can be reproduced anywhere to derive the correct value  the kilogram is currently defined by a golf ball-size lump of metal kept in a vault in France 	1	1	1
Scientists want to change that by defining the kilogram in terms of the weight it would take to counterbalance an electromagnetic force produced by a magnetic coil 	1	1	1
Imaging Landau levels doesn't help set up the balance  but it strengthens the understanding of the underlying theory we have  that the von Klitzing constant is a universal constant  and it tells us it's really true  Roemer said 	2	3	1
We can look at these states and really find them there 	2	2	1
ELITIST  OUT-OF-TOUCH MEDIA COMPLAIN ROMNEY NOT A REGULAR GUY	2	1	2
"After our ambassador to Libya was murdered in a preplanned  coordinated attack on our embassy last week  preceded by an attack on our embassy in Egypt (and followed by attacks on our embassies in Yemen  Indonesia  Tunisia and Lebanon)  Romney criticized the Obama administration for ""sympathizing with those who had breached our embassy in Egypt """	1	1	3
He was referring to a statement put out by our Cairo embassy before the ambassador's murder  criticizing an American filmmaker whose YouTube trailer was the alleged provocation for the attacks  Attacks that happened to occur on the anniversary of 9/11 	2	1	3
"The Obama administration insisted that Romney had his ""facts"" wrong: Obama had absolutely nothing to do with the statement -- the embassy staff was freelancing -- and  even if the White House had approved it  it was a good statement because the riots were caused by the movie trailer  and furthermore  the embassy statement was issued before the riots even began "	1	2	2
"This is known as an argument in the alternative: ""I didn't break into that house  and if I did  I didn't steal the silver  and if I did  I only got twenty bucks for it """	3	1	2
The embassy's statement was obviously responding to something  and if anyone in the administration -- even that rogue embassy official! -- knew the Internet video was upsetting our dear Muslim friends  why on earth weren't our embassies protected?	4	1	3
Next  the Obama administration detained the American filmmaker and asked Google to block the allegedly offending video  (Take the week off  First Amendment )	3	1	2
This behavior made it difficult for even the most obsequious journalist to keep railing against Romney for suggesting that Obama was acquiescing to angry Muslims  So the NFM's harangue against Romney was deposited in the same filing cabinet where the paperwork to close Gitmo is currently stored 	2	1	2
"At a private gathering  Romney told donors that Obama had a lock on the 47 percent of voters ""who pay no income tax"" and ""believe the government has a responsibility to care for them "" This was deeply offensive to people who pay no income tax and believe the government has a responsibility to care for them "	3	1	2
But no matter how much the media belch out the usual cliches -- out of touch  insensitive  racist  not one of us  Thurston Howell  etc  etc  -- all most people heard was: FORTY-SEVEN PERCENT OF AMERICANS PAY NO INCOME TAX?	4	2	3
"A friend of mine who spent time in Russia during the '70s told me that whenever a Russian would bring up the extensive coverage of Watergate  he'd sigh  thinking he'd have to explain that the American political system was not as corrupt as the commissars would have it  But all they ever wanted to ask him was: ""Do all Americans have such nice shoes?"""	2	2	2
The lesson is: You can't always control what the audience notices 	1	1	2
Thanks to the myopia of our one-party media  most journalists are firmly convinced that voters will be appalled by Romney's description of 47 percent of Americans as supporting Obama because they pay no income tax  (Yes  head-up-their-butts journalists in the charming little burg of Manhattan are complaining that Romney isn't connecting with ordinary people )	2	1	2
"But the only people shocked by Romney's statement of fact are those who would never vote Republican under any circumstances  Everyone else is saying  ""Is it really as high as 47 percent?"" -- as the media impotently shouts  ""No  you idiot! That's not the point!"""	3	1	2
There's going to come a time  in the not-distant future  when it's 51 percent paying no income tax  And when that happens  the party of big government will never lose another election  America will become indistinguishable from Western European nanny states -- except there will be no America to protect us 	2	1	2
The media happen to love the party of big government with all their heart  so from now until the election  no matter what Romney says  they plan to be scandalized 	1	2	2
Email Etiquette: 8 Tips for a More Civilized Inbox	1	2	1
Do set up specific signatures for any email accounts you access on smartphones and tablets  The signature should inform people you're mailing from a mobile  It's a great opportunity to apologize for the brevity of responses or even the odd grammar error or typo  without having to explain in the body of the message For example: Typing on an iPhone — excuse my clumsy thumbs!Image courtesy of Alex	2	2	1
Email is an essential part of modern communication  And its dos and don'ts are no longer limited to avoiding caps lock  We have collected eight essential tips for contemporary email etiquette 	3	1	1

(AP) — Several emergency responders have been stung after a flatbed truck carrying honeybees rolled over in rural Nevada 	1	1	3
Authorities say 66-year-old truck driver Rudy Breneman had been hauling a load of bees from Bruce  S D   to California when he pulled to the side of the highway east of Tonopah — about 200 miles northwest of Las Vegas — on Monday afternoon 	1	1	3
Breneman told troopers the big rig started sinking into the soft dirt of the shoulder and eventually tipped over  breaking open many of the hives 	1	1	3
State troopers  sheriff's deputies and firefighters all were stung 	1	1	3
Troopers say firefighters tried to contain the bees with water before beekeepers arrived 	1	1	1
Breneman wasn't injured in the accident and is not being cited 	1	3	1
They're making the banjo respectable  which is not an easy feat  and I'm so glad it's finally happening  Harris joked 	2	4	1
"Harris  an iconic singer and member of the Country Music Hall of Fame  and Mumford & Sons  platinum-selling lads from London who have sparked a folk rock resurgence  are joining together to explore their shared love of high harmony  sad songs and  yes  the oft-belittled banjo on an episode of ""CMT Crossroads"" on Thursday night "	3	2	1
The Nashville-based Harris had only briefly met lead singer Marcus Mumford before agreeing to do the show based on the waves they created in the music world 	2	1	1
They coordinated song choices by phone and got together to rehearse for a little more than a day before recording the show earlier this month 	1	1	1
It was a crash course in catalog consumption and the chance to get to know each other 	2	2	1
They're great harmony (singers) and they've got this great driving groove with a minimalist instrumentation  Harris said 	3	3	1
But they just sound good and the songs have beautiful melodies and I love harmonizing on them 	3	3	1
"You don't have to repeat the past	2	1	1
196 emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721 We learn from the past  but we have to come forward with something different and there are just so many different combinations to make good music that touches people  she said "	2	2	1
Harris  65  was among the gateway artists who helped Mumford and bandmates Ben Lovett  Ted Dwane and Winston Marshall discover their love for American roots music 	1	3	1
"It started with the ""O Brother  Where Art Thou?"" soundtrack "	1	1	1
"Harris appeared with Gillian Welch and Alison Krauss on the memorable song ""Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby """	2	2	1
Pretty much every song that Emmylou has sung on is my favorite song of whichever artist she sang with  Mumford said 	3	3	1
I'm like an obsessive Emmylou Harris freak and I'm not ashamed 	4	3	1
In turn  the quartet has helped shine a light on the influence Harris and the extensive roots underground still exerts 	2	3	1
"Their album ""Sigh No More"" is now double platinum and ""Babel"" is one of the year's most anticipated albums "	2	3	1
For us  it's kind of a bit of a dream come true  Dwane said 	3	4	1
"We'd never thought we'd get to travel so extensively  meet our heroes and collaborate with so many people	3	4	1
196 emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721     We're just having a really nice time "	3	4	1
Like the band  fans have discovered something new in those old sounds 	1	1	1
Folk music has always been there  but it's wonderful to see the infusion of freshness and energy  but still having that passion  Harris said 	2	3	1
"Not just mimicking what went before  but infusing it	2	1	1
196 emmylou-mumford-sons-team-cmt-crossroads-121121721 I was joking about the banjo  but I'm serious "	3	1	1

Endeavour lands at LA airport after aerial tour	1	2	1
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Space shuttle Endeavour landed safely at the Los Angeles International Airport Friday after a whirlwind aerial tour around California landmarks 	2	3	1
Strapped to the back of a 747 jumbo jet  the pair touched down around 1 p m  after a nearly five-hour flyover 	1	1	1
One of the crew members stuck an American flag out of the hatch of the jet 	1	2	1
The flyover took Endeavour over the state Capitol  Golden Gate Bridge  Hollywood Sign and other icons en route to the Los Angeles airport  where the shuttle will be prepped for a slow-speed journey to its museum home next month 	2	3	1
"At the Santa Monica Pier  spectators pointed their cameras skyward and some chanted  ""USA!"	2	4	1
Thousands of spectators jammed rooftop buildings and streets in Sacramento  cheering as Endeavour made two loops around the state Capitol 	2	3	1
A crowd of schoolchildren squealed in delight during the second flyover 	2	3	1
Matthew Montgomery took a break from his work as a legislative aide and brought his 2-year-old son  Tavion  to see Endeavour airborne 	2	2	1
I was going to leave him in daycare but thought this is a once-in-a-lifetime deal  said Montgomery  whose aunt was an engineer on the early Apollo missions 	2	3	1

Endeavour returned to its birthplace Thursday after an emotional cross-country ferry flight that made a special flyover of Tucson  Ariz   to honor its last commander  Mark Kelly  and his wife  former Arizona Rep  Gabrielle Giffords 	2	4	1
NASA's shuttle fleet  which retired last year after three decades of flight  was assembled in Palmdale near Edwards Air Force Base where Endeavour took off Friday morning for the aerial tour 	1	2	1
The military outpost 100 miles north of Los Angeles served as the original shuttle landing strip and remained a backup site in case of stormy weather at Cape Canaveral  Fla 	1	1	1
We're so excited to be welcoming Endeavour home in grand style with these flyovers  Jeffrey Rudolph  president of the California Science Center  said earlier this week 	2	4	1
The youngest shuttle  Endeavour replaced Challenger  which blew up during liftoff in 1986 	1	2	3
NASA lost another shuttle  Columbia  in 2003 when it disintegrated during re-entry 	1	1	3
During 25 missions  Endeavour spent 299 days in space and orbited Earth nearly 4 700 times  racking up 123 million miles 	1	2	1
On its maiden flight in 1992  a trio of spacewalking astronauts grabbed a stranded communications satellite in for repair 	1	3	1
It also flew the first repair mission to the Hubble Space Telescope to fix a faulty mirror 	1	3	1
But most of its flights ferried cargo and equipment to the International Space Station  which is near completion 	1	2	1
Endeavour is the second of three remaining shuttles to head to its retirement home 	1	1	1
In April  Discovery arrived at the Smithsonian Institution's hangar in Virginia 	1	1	1
Atlantis  which closed out the shuttle program  will stay in Florida where it will be towed a short distance to the Kennedy Space Center's visitor center in the fall 	1	2	1
Endeavour will remain at an airport hangar for several weeks as crews ready the shuttle for its own road trip 	1	1	1
Unlike Atlantis  it will creep through city streets to the California Science Center near downtown 	1	2	1
Museum officials have pledged to replant double the number of chopped trees 	1	2	2
Endeavour leaves Houston for new home in Calif 	1	1	1
HOUSTON (AP) — Space shuttle Endeavour has departed Houston on its trek west to retirement in a Los Angeles museum 	1	1	1
Endeavour  atop a modified jumbo jet  left Thursday morning after a one-day stop at the home of NASA's Mission Control 	1	1	1
It continues its journey to Los Angeles International Airport  where it's scheduled to land Friday 	1	1	1
In mid-October  Endeavour will be transported down city streets to the California Science Center 	1	1	1
This is the last flight for a space shuttle 	1	1	1
The plane transporting the Endeavor will do a flyover of Tucson  Ariz   along the way to honor former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords 	1	1	1
Houston's bid for one of the retired shuttles was rejected  and it has instead received a replica 	1	2	2
EU body backs Novartis' Galvus  Eucreas for diabetes indications	1	2	1
ZURICH (Reuters) - European regulators on Friday issued positive opinions for new indications of Novartis AG drugs Galvus and Eucreas in combination with other treatments for type 2 diabetes patients 	2	3	1
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion for Galvus in combination with insulin  with or without metformin  for patients with type 2 diabetes when diet  exercise and a stable dose of insulin do not result in glycemic control 	1	2	1
The second positive opinion was for Eucreas in triple combination with metformin and sulphonylurea also for the treatment of type 2 diabetes when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these two agents do not provide adequate glycemic control 	1	2	1
Galvus is already approved in more than 100 countries and Eucreas in over 80 countries 	2	2	1
EU moves step closer to non-Russia gas link-up	1	1	1
At a ceremony in New York on Thursday  the three countries signed a memorandum of understanding bringing the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) closer to reality  although building was not likely to commence until 2014 or 2015 	2	1	1
The deal improves TAP's chances against Nabucco West  the other remaining contender in the race to become the first pipeline to deliver Azeri gas to Europe  diversifying the supply 	1	2	1
"TAP's managing director Kjetil Tungland called the agreement ""a testament to TAP's commercial and technical strengths"" and the European commissioner for energy  Guenther Oettinger  said it represented a significant breakthrough "	2	2	1
This is another important step towards our aim to get gas directly from the Caspian region  Oettinger said on Friday 	3	2	1
"Nabucco West spokesman Christian Dolezal said Nabucco still had ""the most advanced legal framework"" and therefore remained in a strong position to challenge TAP "	2	1	1
We consider this a benchmark in the Southern Corridor  he said 	2	1	1
BID TO DIVERSIFY SUPPLIES	1	1	1
The Southern Corridor is the Commission's name for whichever project is selected to help wean the continent off its dependence on Russia  which supplies more than 30 percent of all EU gas imports  including nearly 100 percent in six EU states 	1	1	1
Tension between the European Union and Russia over energy has flared repeatedly and worsened since the Commission  the EU's executive  announced this month that it was investigating suspected anti-competitive practices by Gazprom   Russia state-controlled gas monopoly 	2	1	2
In its bid for diversification  the Commission says it does not favor any particular project  insisting that its aim is only to make gas supplies more secure and competitive 	2	2	1
Whether TAP or Nabucco West wins depends on the consortium of companies that operates the Azeri field that will supply the gas  known as Shah Deniz II 	2	1	1
TAP's shareholders are EGL AG of Switzerland (42 5 percent)  Norway's Statoil (42 5 percent) and E ON Ruhrgas of Germany (15 percent)  	1	1	1
Analysts have said a weakness of the project is its lack of Italian partners 	2	1	1
Some argue a pipeline into Italy would never secure political backing without an Italian company as investor 	2	1	2
For its part  the Italian government is seeking to turn Italy into a southern European gas hub in an effort to reduce energy prices  which are among the highest in Europe and damaging Italian companies at a time of economic crisis 	1	1	1
Nabucco's six shareholders are Austria's OMV AG   Germany's RWE AG   Hungary's MOL through its gas pipeline operator FGSZ  Turkey's Botas  BEH of Bulgaria and Romania's Transgaz  	1	1	1
EU seeks $12B in sanctions vs US over Boeing case	1	1	2
GENEVA (AP) — The European Union is seeking some $12 billion in sanctions against the United States as part of a long-running dispute before the World Trade Organization involving subsidies to plane makers Airbus and Boeing 	1	1	2
The Geneva-based trade body said Thursday that the EU plans request on Oct  23 the right to impose the sanctions 	1	1	2
On Monday  the U S  claimed it had complied with a March WTO ruling against illegal subsidies to Boeing by stopping some payouts to the company through NASA and the Pentagon and by removing some beneficial tax and funding policies 	1	1	2
The WTO panel has also ruled that European governments provided $18 billion in subsidies to Airbus — though not all were deemed illegal 	1	2	2
EU seeks foreign market access to boost ailing airlines	1	2	2
Airlines in Europe suffered more than in other major regions following the global financial crisis and EU carriers are expected to lose $1 1 billion this year 	2	1	3
Most countries restrict foreign ownership of airlines  with a limit of 25 percent of voting shares in the United States and 49 percent in much of the European Union 	1	1	1
But the European Commission wants to sign agreements with Washington and others to relax or even remove such constraints 	2	2	2
It is now time to address this issue more vigorously 	3	2	2
The EU Commission said it will seek approval from EU governments early next year to begin talks with China  Russia  India  the Gulf states and others on improving mutual access to their aviation markets 	2	2	1
It will also seek a market liberalization deal with the United States under an existing transatlantic air transport agreement 	2	2	1
The Commission said the total economic benefit of concluding the deals was estimated at 12 billion euros ($15 billion) per year 	3	3	1
"This is about maintaining our global relevance	3	2	1
204 eu-seeks-foreign-market-access-boost-ailing-airlines-124811566--finance This is crucial  not just for European aviation  but for our economies at large  said ACI Europe's Director General Olivier Jankovec "	3	2	1
Negotiations could be complicated by a bitter row with the United States  China and India over the European Union's decision to force foreign airlines using its airports to pay for their carbon emissions  the bloc's transport chief said 	3	1	3
It is a problem for aviation relations with certain partners  but I hope very much that we can conclude negotiations  Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas told a news briefing 	3	2	2

European lawmakers warn of banking union split	1	1	2
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Creation of a banking union to help resolve the euro zone debt crisis could lead to a split within the wider European Union  lawmakers in the European Parliament warned during a debate that laid bare the extent of tensions in the bloc 	1	1	3
However  the plan has sparked concerns among the 10 EU countries which do not use the euro that they will be indirectly affected by the ECB's new supervisory powers and put at a competitive disadvantage  whether they join the scheme or not 	1	1	3
What's the point of having a single supervisory mechanism (for the euro zone) when you have the UK with its 60 percent of the financial market not involved? said Werner Langen  a German lawmaker  in the debate on Wednesday 	3	1	2
Instead of a single supervisory mechanism  we have a division of Europe  a very explosive division 	3	1	2
What we don't want to do here is split the EU down the middle  said Wolf Klinz  a German member of parliament 	2	1	2
What we don't want to see is that the British push themselves into a corner where they have a referendum and they say     that's enough for us 	2	1	2
As well as building the foundation for better control of banks  the union would be important because it should allow the euro zone's rescue fund  the European Stability Mechanism (ESM)  to directly inject much-needed capital into banks  such as those in Spain 	1	3	1
"The whole European system of banking supervision is being turned on its head for the sake of Spain	3	1	3
205 european-lawmakers-warn-banking-union-split-111000118--finance As this thing has been turned on its head  we need to turn it back again  Langen said "	3	2	2
The debate underscored a central problem of the union - that it could drive a wedge between those countries inside the scheme and those outside  whose banks may suffer as a result 	2	1	3
Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg has said he would not accept ECB oversight of Nordea   the Nordic region's biggest bank  as long as his country remains outside a banking union 	1	1	2
While Britain will stay outside the scheme  many international banks in London - ranging from HSBC to Citi - have operations in the euro zone that will be affected by the ECB's new supervisory reach 	1	1	1
London is worried that the ECB  emboldened by its new powers  will demand regulation that could undermine the city's position as Europe's financial capital 	1	1	2
Some believe that the European Banking Authority (EBA)  set up to coordinate the supervision of banks in response to the financial crisis and which is run by regulators from across the European Union  could act as a counterbalance 	1	1	2
The European Commission has already suggested a special voting mechanism among EU regulators as a counterweight to the power of those in the euro zone 	1	2	1
The system should be so attractive that everyone will want to join  Giegold said  in an appeal which is likely to be ignored in London 	4	2	2
The close ties between some troubled governments and the banks they supervise - and on which they also rely to buy their debt - have dragged both ever-deeper into crisis 	1	1	2
A banking union would break this link by making the policing of banks supranational and establishing central schemes paid into collectively to cover the costs of closing failed lenders and protecting savers' deposits 	1	1	2
Spaniard Sergio Garcia turned around his match against Jim Furyk by winning the last two holes for a one-up victory 	2	2	1
I have no doubt in my mind that he was with me today all day  Garcia said about compatriot Ballesteros  who breathed fire into the Ryder Cup after the Britain-Ireland team was expanded to include players from all of Europe 	3	3	1
Because there's no chance I would have won my match if he wasn't there 	3	3	1
Ballesteros died last year at age 54 after a battle with cancer 	1	1	3
Olazabal  who formed the most successful Ryder Cup tandem alongside Ballesteros  told the team in their meeting on Saturday night that he felt Seve in the room and that he could help propel the Europeans to a victory despite trailing 10-6 	2	2	1
Wearing blue and white  the favorite colors of the fiery Spanish competitor  Europe took apart the host team to match the biggest final-day points comeback ever in the Ryder Cup 	3	3	1
The U S  team had overcome the same margin to beat Europe in 1999 at Brookline  with Olazabal left gloomy on the 17th green in the clinching match 	2	2	1
But that record Ryder comeback took place before a roaring U S  home crowd and this amazing Europe fight back came on foreign soil 	2	3	1
The first five European players won their singles matches and the competition came down to the final two matches when 2010 PGA Championship winner Martin Kaymer sank a five-footer at the 18th to clinch it 	2	2	1
"We wanted to show our grit	3	2	1

Englishman Ian Poulter  added to the team as a wild-card pick by Olazabal  beat U S  Open champion Webb Simpson two up to complete an impeccable Cup with wins in all four of his matches 	2	3	1
My captain picked me to come and play  and you know  I owe it to him  and Seve  to be here today  he said 	3	2	1
Olazabal  who had tears in his eyes after the victory  said he got emotional thinking about Ballesteros 	3	4	2
I want to thank them for what they did today 	3	3	1

Healthy lungs are home to bacterial communities  just as healthy intestines and skin are 	1	1	1
That was one finding of new research that also showed that while patients with cystic fibrosis may be hampered by the bacterial communities that live in their lungs  it is the composition of these colonies  rather than their mere presence  that causes problems 	1	1	2
For many years  people have considered the lung to be a relatively sterile organ  said study researcher Dr  David Cornfield  a professor of pediatrics at the Stanford University School of Medicine 	1	1	1
This provides some of the first and most definitive data that there is a forest of flora that exist in the lung  that are present even in the healthy lung 	2	1	1
The finding also suggests that probiotics could help in the treatment of cystic fibrosis  a genetic disorder that results from receiving copies of a recessive gene from both parents 	1	2	1
The disorder results in thicker  stickier mucus in the lungs and other organs  which allows certain bacteria to overgrow 	1	1	2
Patients tend not to live past age 40 	1	1	3
In the new study  researchers examined the sputum from 16 cystic fibrosis patients and nine healthy control patients  and surveyed the organisms present using gene sequencing 	1	1	1
By examining the genes  rather than growing the bacteria in lab dishes  the researchers were able to get a better handle on the diversity of bacteria present 	1	1	1
While each person studied had a unique bacterial community in their lungs  the cystic fibrosis patients had communities that were more similar to each other than to those of the healthy people 	1	1	1
The patients' communities were also less diverse 	1	1	1
This suggests there's probably some benefit to having bacteria in the lungs  to some balanced degree  Cornfield said 	2	2	1
"Instead  he said the findings support the idea of thinking of the bacteria in the lungs as a ""rain forest """	3	1	1
We know that in a rain forest  if species are lost  there develops an imbalance  and the ecosystem becomes much more fragile  Cornfield said 	1	1	1
While the lungs have been thought of as sterile  this is not the first study to find bacteria in healthy lungs  although the idea of communities is still somewhat controversial 	2	1	1
Anything that comes into contact with the world is not going to be sterile  said Katrine Whiteson  a postdoctoral fellow at San Diego State University who studies microbe communities in the human body 	2	1	1
"Whiteson said one issue not addressed by this study  but that is being tackled elsewhere  is the question of whether bacteria remain in the lungs over the long term  or whether they are ""tourists"" — with some strains leaving a person's lungs and new ones entering "	2	1	1
The new research  Cornfield said  could lead to better treatments for cystic fibrosis patients 	1	2	1
He said long-term antibiotics  a treatment given to many patients today  might become more effective if combined with probiotics to enhance bacterial diversity in patients lungs  although much more research is necessary to see if that is the case 	1	2	1
That would be a paradigm shift of virtually epic proportions in the cystic fibrosis and even the lung biology community  Cornfield said 	2	1	1
Everything you need to know about the NFL referee lockout	3	1	1
After three weeks of controversial calls  which culminated in a game-changing decision in a matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers on Monday  news outlets have reported that the referees and the NFL are close to signing a deal 	2	1	1
As the lockout approaches its end  it's worth looking back at how it began 	2	1	1
What is the dispute about?	1	1	1
Who should be blamed?	1	1	1
And what does it mean for the future of the football season?	1	1	1
Here  everything you need to know about the NFL's referee lockout:	3	1	1
What are the NFL and the referees fighting about?There are several areas of disagreement  but the biggest sticking point is money 	1	1	2
Fans and commentators have expressed both frustration with this solution and sympathy for the stand-in refs' inexperience 	1	1	2
What do the NFL players think?The vast majority have sided with the referees 	2	1	1
"Many players have spoken of their exasperation in post-game interviews  or taken to Twitter  voicing complaints like ""I thought I was watching Punk'd"" and calling the use of replacements ""a slap in the face """	2	1	2
What do sportswriters think?They're furious 	2	1	2
"The NFL used to be the Mona Lisa  says Rick Reilly at ESPN com  rather grandly  and the referee's strike ""is painting a mustache on it """	4	1	1
Has the lockout hurt the NFL?In reputation  yes  in revenue  no 	3	1	2
Will the lockout really end soon?Reports are mixed 	1	1	1
"According to ESPN com  an ""agreement in principle"" is ready  and the remaining points of contention are minor enough that locked-out officials may even be on the field again by Sunday "	2	2	1
"But the Los Angeles Times countered  quoting an inside source that says ""a deal is not as close as has been reported """	2	1	1

Ex-Intel executive sentenced in NYC for fraud	1	1	3
NEW YORK (AP) — A former Intel executive was credited for his extensive cooperation as he was sentenced in New York to probation for feeding confidential information about the computer-chip maker to a billionaire hedge fund manager 	2	2	3
"Rajiv Goel apologized and said he was ""deeply ashamed"" before he was sentenced Monday in federal court in Manhattan "	2	1	4
Judge Barbara Jones also fined the Los Altos  Calif 	1	1	3
He admitted supplying secret details about Intel's investments to an influential hedge fund founder he met at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business in the early 1980s 	1	1	3
Ex-wrestler props up India's PM  but he may want the job	2	2	1
LUCKNOW  India (Reuters) - As a former wrestler  Mulayam Singh Yadav has got India's government where he likes it - in a vice-like grip 	2	2	1
The ructions over fresh economic reforms that reduced the ruling coalition to a parliamentary minority last month left Prime Minister Manmohan Singh dependent on this wheeler-dealer from the country's dusty northern plains 	2	2	1
In an interview with Reuters  Yadav insisted there were no strings attached to his support for Singh's Congress party  just a desire to keep the opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of power 	3	2	1
We are supporting them  he said in the Hindi language  looking hearty for his 72 years despite rumors earlier this year that his health was failing 	3	2	2
There are no conditions of any kind  it's only to ensure communal forces do not get strengthened 	3	2	2
However  Yadav is at least as well known for his maneuvering as he was in his youth for pinning opponents down in a wrestling bout: Congress party leaders know he cannot be trusted to stick with them through thick and thin - and few are convinced when he denies any ambition to one day become prime minister 	3	2	2
For now  the 22 lawmakers of Yadav's Samajwadi (Socialist) Party will side with the government  ensuring it can muster the 272 votes needed in parliament to prevent its collapse 	2	2	2
Their support became crucial after another regional party leader left the coalition  angry over hikes in the price of subsidized fuel and a decision to open India's doors to foreign supermarket giants 	3	2	3
Yadav's take on the reforms is that he opposes them  but will nevertheless continue to support the government 	2	2	2
We will oppose anything that goes against the interests of the people  he said 	3	3	1
But we will not allow the government to fall 	3	2	1
A FAMILY BUSINESS	1	1	1
Yadav was born to a rural family in Uttar Pradesh  India's most populous state with 200 million people and - since it sends more lawmakers to Delhi than any other - its politically most important 	2	2	1
As a young man  he trained as a wrestler before being attracted to socialism and local politics  eventually becoming chief minister of the state three times and federal defense minister in a coalition government during the 1990s 	1	1	1
Six months ago  when his Samajwadi Party returned to power in Uttar Pradesh after a hiatus  Yadav stood aside for his son Akhilesh to head the state government 	1	1	1
Impeccably dressed in the starched white dhoti-kurta of the region and his salt-and-pepper hair still damp from a mid-morning bath  he showed few signs of age as he strode out from under the porch of his home  chatting with aides and party colleagues 	3	3	1
In India  where caste and family play hugely important roles in politics  the Yadavs have several advantages 	2	2	1
They are from a land-owning lower caste whose members were mostly subsistence farmers and cattle herders  but have become wealthier  more politically aware and socially assertive in recent decades 	2	2	2
Yadav  his daughter-in-law Dimple  a cousin and a nephew are in the federal parliament 	1	2	1
A brother is in the Uttar Pradesh state government headed by Akhilesh 	1	2	1
On the negative side  the party is anathema for other lower caste groups 	2	1	2
Critics also say it is tarred by association with people who have criminal pasts  and previous Samajwadi Party rule in Uttar Pradesh brought rampant corruption and increased violence 	2	1	3
The other family firmly entrenched in Indian politics is the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has ruled the country for a majority of the years since independence in 1947  and also looks on Uttar Pradesh as its base 	2	2	1
He is a new leader  a nice man  a youth leader  Akhilesh said in a separate interview 	3	3	1
"We are of the same age	2	1	1
211 ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business His party should give him an opportunity "	3	2	1
INDIA'S NEXT PRIME MINISTER?	1	1	1
Although the Congress party-led coalition could coax other parties to keep it alive  for now it is dependent on Mulayam Singh Yadav  who is widely expected to demand a pound of flesh despite his professed unconditional support 	2	2	1
News reports have said he will press for an illegal wealth case against him to be dropped  and for impoverished Uttar Pradesh to get more federal aid 	3	2	2
Analysts and voter surveys suggest no clear winner will emerge in those polls  meaning the Third Front may well have the parliamentary numbers to stake a claim to power 	2	2	1
Since Yadav's party won Uttar Pradesh with a large majority  odds are he will have enough lawmakers in parliament after the 2014 elections to put him in pole position to form a coalition  and to head it 	2	2	1
"Asked if Yadav could become prime minister  Sudha Pai  a political scientist who is rector at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University  said: ""He knows how to make a deal  how to get on with other political parties "	3	3	1
"He is very good at negotiating  he is the traditional Indian politician """	3	3	1
"Yadav dismisses such ambitions: ""I have never been a candidate for prime ministership  and I am not now "" he said "	3	1	1
But the murmurs in his party  where he is called Netaji  or leader  are growing 	2	1	1
It could be joined by other regional parties and left-wing groups and even a section of the Congress party could be won over to cobble a majority  analysts say 	3	2	1
Akhilesh  the son and new chief minister  says governing Uttar Pradesh is as important to him as increasing numbers in parliament 	3	2	1
"I have to perform  and if people believe that my government has performed well  then the result will be good	3	3	1
211 ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business My priority is Uttar Pradesh "" said the 39-year-old  a contrast  at least on the surface  to his politician father "	3	2	1
He was trained as an environment engineer and was once a keen footballer and Manchester United supporter 	2	2	1
If we go to the center  Netaji will go there (and) some of our senior leadership  but I am happy in the state  he said  adding the party was not looking to topple Prime Minister Singh 	3	3	1
His father is similarly cautious 	2	2	1
In 2014  Samajwadi will fight on its own strength  there will be no understanding with anyone  he said 	3	2	1
"After the elections  things (alliances) happen  nothing happens before	3	2	1
211 ex-wrestler-props-indias-pm-may-want-job-211246791--business Depending on the circumstances  we will take decisions then "	3	2	1
Exclusive: Facebook to charge merchants to run Offers	1	1	1
Facebook launched Facebook Offers earlier this year  letting retailers and other local merchants send deals to their Facebook fans 	1	1	1
Users claim the offers from their News Feeds and redeem the vouchers at stores to get discounts 	1	1	1
The service has been free  but in coming weeks Facebook will require merchants to pay at least $5 on related ads to promote each Facebook Offer to a targeted audience of fans and friends of fans 	1	1	1
The cost will vary based on the size of a company's Facebook pages 	1	1	1
Since Facebook went public in May  the company has been under pressure from Wall Street to show how it can turn its giant social network into a money machine 	2	1	1
Facebook shares have lost about 40 percent of their value since the IPO 	1	1	2
The commerce potential of Facebook  known as f-commerce  has yet to materialize  partly because retailers have been able to feast on a host of free tools on the social network to attract customers 	2	1	1
We think this aligns incentives nicely  said Gokul Rajaram  director of product management for Facebook's advertising and Pages businesses 	3	2	1
The best results on Facebook Offers will come from organic distribution plus paid distribution 	2	2	1
In the past  some Facebook Offers have not been relevant to all users  partly because some people saw deals in their News Feeds from merchants located far away from where they live  Rajaram added 	1	1	1
Before  the service was available only to merchants with physical locations 	1	1	1
Facebook is also adding barcodes for offers  so customers can redeem offers more easily 	2	1	1
The barcodes work globally  Rajaram noted 	1	1	1
The executive declined to disclose how many Facebook Offers have been run so far  how many merchants have taken part  or how many deals have been claimed and redeemed by consumers 	1	1	1
"However  he said Facebook is ""very happy"" with the success of its Offers business "	2	2	1
That's why we're expanding and investing more in it  Rajaram said 	2	1	1
Exclusive Media Acquires Stake in Millenium Entertainment	1	2	1
#NAME?	1	2	1
Under this new deal  Exclusive Releasing will use Millenium's home entertainment distribution infrastructure to push out its growing list of titles 	1	2	1
The deal brings together two new but prominent players in the film community 	2	2	1
Guy East and Nigel Sinclair run Exclusive Media  founded in 2008 as a full-service studio with development  financing  production  marketing and distribution teams 	1	1	1
Three different labels handle development and production - Hammer for genre films  Spitfire for documentaries and Exclusive for everything else 	1	1	1
"Owned by Nu Image/Millenium Films  it acquires and distributes film projects such as Lee Daniels' upcoming ""The Paperboy"" and ""Bernie """	1	1	1
We've known Nigel and Guy for many years  Avi Lerner and Trevor Short  co-founders of Nu Image  said in a statement 	2	2	1
Exclusive Media has excellent taste and is making some great films so we're excited by this arrangement and look forward to Exclusive Media bringing further impetus to the next stage of Millennium Entertainment's growth 	3	3	1
"Exclusive: Spain ready for bailout  Germany signals ""wait""- sources"	1	1	2
The latest twist in the euro zone's three-year-old sovereign debt crisis comes as financial markets and some other European partners are pressuring Madrid to seek a rescue program that would trigger European Central Bank buying of its bonds 	3	1	4
The Spanish were a bit hesitant but now they are ready to request aid  a senior European source said 	3	2	2
Three other euro zone senior euro zone sources confirmed the shift in the Spanish position  all speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter 	2	1	2
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has said Spain is taking all the right steps to overcome its fiscal problems and does not need a bailout  arguing that investors will recognize and reward Spanish reforms in due course 	3	2	2
Privately  several European diplomats and a senior German source said Chancellor Angela Merkel preferred to avoid putting more individual bailouts for distressed euro zone countries to her increasingly reluctant parliament 	3	1	3
It doesn't make sense to send looming decisions on Greece  Cyprus and possibly also Spain to the Bundestag one by one  the senior German source said 	3	1	3
Participants said there were tense exchanges at a euro zone ministerial meeting in Cyprus in mid-September when Schaeuble told his peers Berlin could not take another bailout for Spain to parliament so soon after lawmakers approved up to 100 billion euros ($129 billion) to help Spanish banks in July 	3	2	4
STALLING?	2	1	2
Brussels is keen to avoid another paroxysm of the debt crisis by getting support to Spain before it is on the brink of being forced out of the bond market  at the risk of contagion spreading to Italy and other euro zone states 	2	2	4
Rehn met Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Economy Minister Luis de Guindos in Madrid and said afterwards the conditions of any aid program were well known to all euro zone governments 	2	2	1
Conditions would be based on country-specific recommendations that were decided for all 27 EU member states in July and there would be a clear set of policy priorities and clear timelines on the basis of these country-specific recommendations  he told a news conference 	3	2	1
Euro zone officials are considering a so-called Enhanced Conditions Credit Line that would keep Spain in the credit markets with support from the euro zone rescue funds in the primary bond market and from the ECB in the secondary market 	2	2	2
There has been widespread speculation that Rajoy was stalling a bailout bid until after October 21 regional elections in his home state of Galicia and the Basque Country 	4	1	2
But diplomats said it was German discouragement  not Spanish pride  that was now holding back a request for assistance 	3	1	2
"One senior European diplomat said the Spanish position was: ""We are in favor if everyone else accepts """	3	2	2
Madrid did not want to risk submitting an application and having Berlin rebuff it by raising unacceptable conditions such as deep pension cuts or procedural obstacles  he said 	3	1	3
The senior euro zone source said Spanish leaders had understood that making a move now was the best way of avoiding losing market access and being forced into a full state bailout 	2	2	2
The German U-turns have convinced the Spanish they could end up in the not too distant future in the same position as Greece  Portugal or Ireland - shut out of the markets and with a very harsh adjustment program  the source said 	3	1	4
The Spanish government said it would enact 43 structural reforms over the next six months and Brussels said the detailed timetable goes beyond what the Commission has asked of Spain and is an ambitious step forward 	2	3	1
Rehn said he was fully confident Spain would take the necessary steps to restore the economy to health and added it must continue reforming its pension system  linking retirement age to life expectancy 	3	3	2
Rajoy has said pensions are the last thing he would cut as he introduces sweeping savings through the social security system  though he has said he would introduce a new law on pensions before the end of the year 	2	2	3
Spain needs to refinance some 29 billion euros in maturing debt -- including 9 billion in short-term paper -- by the end of this month 	1	1	3
The senior euro zone source said that under one scenario under consideration  Spain was ready to submit the request at the weekend  with German agreement  so euro zone finance ministers could discuss it at their next regular meeting in Luxembourg next Monday 	2	2	1
Failing that  Madrid could make the application before an EU summit in Brussels on October 18-19  but euro zone partners such as France and Italy  which are pushing for an early decision  would not want it to drag on beyond then  the source said 	3	2	2
Facebook Begins Eliminating Fake Likes  Page Fan Counts Drop	1	2	2
Facebook has begun eliminating fake Likes on brand Pages  after pledging to ramp up security in August 	2	2	1
On Wednesday  the social network started weeding out bogus Likes caused by compromised accounts  deceived users  malware or purchased bulk Likes  it confirmed to TechCrunch 	2	3	1
"Less than 1% of Likes on a page would be removed  ""providing they and their affiliates have been abiding by our terms "" Facebook said in a blog post "	1	2	2
The percentage is consistent with data provided by PageData  an independent Facebook Page tracking service 	1	1	1
Among Pages with the most total Likes  Texas HoldEm Poker saw a loss of more than 96 000 Likes in the past day  according to the service  That clocks in around 0 15% of its 65 3 million total Likes 	1	1	2
Other top offenders included singers Rihanna who lost 28 000 Likes  Shakira who shed 26 000 and Lady Gaga who dropped 34 000 	2	1	3
Zynga's Farmville game was another big loser with 45 000 Likes gone 	3	1	3
"Facebook previously said it had ""dedicated protections"" against threats that result in fake Likes  but emphasized that these improved systems to safeguard the network's integrity ""have been specially configured to identify and take action against suspicious Likes """	2	2	2
"Users will continue to connect to the Pages and Profiles they authentically want to subscribe to  and Pages will have a more accurate measurement of fan count and demographics  Facebook wrote in its August post  ""This improvement will allow Pages to produce ever more relevant and interesting content  and brands will see an increase in true engagement around their content """	1	2	1
Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment 	1	1	2
Facebook (FB) has begun testing a new photo sync feature in its Android application that will automatically upload photos taken to the Web 	1	1	1
Once photos have been synced to the Web  users can then pick and choose which images should be shared with friends 	1	1	1
The feature is similar to those found on Google+  Dropbox and Apple’s (AAPL) Photostream  all of which offer online photo syncing 	1	1	1
Facebook is currently testing the feature with a small number of users and it is unclear if  or when  the social networking site will roll out photo sync globally 	1	1	1
Facebook Bug Creates Wall Posts That Can Never Be Deleted	1	1	1
A Facebook bug allows you to posts messages on friend’s walls that he or she can never delete 	1	1	1
Since the content is no longer visible  it's also not deletable by either party unless the block is removed 	1	1	1
"That's clearly noted when you start to block a person on the site ""Blocking means you won't be able to see on contact each other of Facebook "" however  it's a one-sided agreement that doesn't notify the person being blocked  and leaves all of the content you've posted up to that point still in tact  just not visible to either of you "	2	1	2
To test the theory  I posted a photo of a Spy Cat on Mashable Business Editor Todd Wasserman’s wall 	1	1	1
He was able to see the message when I posted it  however  when I blocked him a few minutes later the image was no longer visible to him or I  but was visible to Christina Warren who was his Facebook friend 	1	1	1
Since you can’t remove what you can’t see  Todd could have potentially never realized a posted the photo in the first place  although it would still be visible to his entire friend base for eternity 	2	1	2
He also won’t be able to delete that post from his wall  nor will I unless I decide to unblock him on the site 	1	1	1
While our cat experiment is certainly harmless  the vunerability could certainly be used maliciously  and for posting photo a bit more risqué than a cat looking through some window blinds 	2	2	2

Facebook party turns to rioting in Netherlands	1	1	2
AMSTERDAM (AP) — Police and prosecutors say they are investigating how rioting erupted after thousands of revelers descended on a small Dutch town for a party that was inadvertently advertised on Facebook 	2	1	2
Authorities say 34 people were arrested Friday night and in the early hours of Saturday morning as rioters clashed with police in Haren  185 kilometers (115 miles) north of Amsterdam 	1	1	2
"Mayor Rob Bats said Saturday: ""Scum ran amok in our town """	4	1	3
Dutch media reported that the party originally was planned as a small celebration by a 16-year-old girl but her invitation went viral when she posted it on Facebook 	1	1	1
"Some of the people arriving in Haren on Friday wore T-shirts emblazoned with ""Project X Haren "" a reference to the film ""Project X"" that portrayed an out-of-control party "	1	1	1
Facebook Posts Can Attract Legal Attention	1	1	1
Social media is still pretty new 	1	1	1

The government of India-administered Kashmir has blocked Facebook and YouTube  highlighting concerns about a clampdown on freedom of speech in the disputed region 	1	1	2
The move follows a gradual increase in online surveillance throughout the past few years in Kashmir  as youths have turned to social media as a form of political expression  After people in the Kashmir Valley protested the recent anti-Islam video that unleashed similar protests across the Muslim world  observers say it gave the government the excuse it was looking for and YouTube and Facebook went dead 	2	1	2
“This is one more step in pursuit of depriving the people of avenues of expression  The telecast of blasphemous film on YouTube simply served as a pretext to execute a predetermined policy by the government ” says Sheikh Showkat Hussain  a political analyst and academic who teaches human rights at Kashmir University 	2	1	2
Kashmir’s state government has clamped down on freedom of speech in the past  During mass street protests in 2008  the government banned SMS text messaging  And since another protest wave in 2010  a number of college students have been arrested and taken to Cyber Cell Police Station  located in the summer capital of Srinagar  for posting or uploading anti-India text or pictures on Facebook or YouTube 	2	1	2
“Such a move by the government is a serious infringement on the freedom of speech ” says Sameer Yasir  assistant professor at the Centre for International Relations at the Islamic University of Science and Technology  The state has long wanted to block these specific sites  he says  but worried about popular outcry  This unprecedented step  he says  ultimately causes free speech to suffer  “This is unethical because social networking sites provide information to people  [A] gag on these sites is a suffering ” he says 	3	1	2
Dr  Hussain agrees: “Avenues of communication remain strangulated in Kashmir ” he says  “Internet was allowed after a lot of persuasion and resentment ” he adds  “However  with the passage of time other avenues of expression and communication were choked  The local news channels [have been] unable to telecast news and commentary since 2010 mass protests  SMS is banned on prepaid mobile networks ”	3	1	2
"The Internet has been widely used by people in Kashmir  especially as a tool during times of military clampdown  Groups resisting Indian rule use Facebook to disseminate their message through Facebook pages such as ""Freedom of Dawn "" ""Hoshar Jamaat"" (Awakened Group)  and ""Kale Kharaab"" (Hot Headed) "	1	1	1
The popular separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani has been using YouTube as a way to get around the fact that the state government doesn’t allow him to address any public rally or go to Friday prayers 	1	1	2
One popular Facebook group  Aalaw (A call)  found a way to still post a protest  The group recently posted on its feed: “Facebook partially banned in valley  sms banned  people caged this is what you called indian demon-crazy  Down with indian state and its policies  Aalaw will continue to reach you no matter facebook gets blocked in valley  Aalaw Radio Is on Cards (sic)”	3	1	2
The private Internet service providers said their customer care executives reported that Facebook and YouTube would be restored after the ban is lifted by the government  but they are not sure when that will happen 	1	1	2

Fairway faces mice problem in Manhattan store	1	1	2

Falcons go to 4-0 with 30-28 win over Panthers	1	1	1
ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Falcons never trailed in their first three games 	1	1	1
Now they know they can play from behind  too 	1	1	1
Rallying in the final minute from their 1-yard line  the unbeaten Falcons scrambled into position for Matt Bryant's 40-yard field goal with 5 seconds remaining and pulled out a 30-28 victory over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday 	1	2	1
Atlanta (4-0) is off to its best start since 2004  when the Falcons reached the NFC championship game 	1	2	1
This team has even higher goals 	1	2	1
We're not good enough to play every game from ahead  coach Mike Smith said 	3	1	2
No one was more resilient than Matt Ryan 	2	1	1
Shaking off a career-high seven sacks  the Falcons' quarterback dropped back into his own end zone and threw up a pass that Roddy White snatched away between two defenders for a 59-yard gain 	1	1	1
After a pass interference and a couple of short completions  Bryant won it with a kick right down the middle 	1	2	1
We're right where we need to be in terms of our record  said Ryan  who threw for 369 yards and three touchdowns despite taking an awful beating 	2	2	2
After squandering a 24-14 lead in the second half  the Falcons needed a crucial fumble by Cam Newton to even have a chance — and they still faced long odds when the Panthers downed a punt at the Atlanta 1 with 1:09 remaining 	2	1	2
Ryan had no timeouts and surely some doubt about how much time his beleaguered offensive line would give him 	3	1	1
But he dropped back about as far as he could  threw it about as far as he could  and relied on White to go up and make the catch 	3	1	1
He did  the biggest catch of all on a day when he had eight for 169 yards 	1	1	1
"Matt told me he was going to throw it up there 	1	1	1
227 falcons-4-0-30-28-win-over-panthers-102848973--spt Just make a play  said White  who also had a pair of touchdowns "	1	1	1
Newton threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score 	1	1	1
But he let the ball slip away when it looked as though he had clinched the victory for the Panthers (1-3) 	2	1	2
You have to protect the football  Newton said 	2	1	1
"That was a key focus going into this game  and I fumbled	1	1	1
227 falcons-4-0-30-28-win-over-panthers-102848973--spt There's a lot of guys that are trusting the ballcarrier  and I was the ballcarrier that particular play to get the job done	2	1	1
227 falcons-4-0-30-28-win-over-panthers-102848973--spt And I dropped the ball "	1	1	1
On third-and-2 at the Atlanta 46  Newton took the snap and bulled his way over the left side  his body surging across the spot needed for the first down 	2	1	1
But John Abraham knocked it loose  the ball squirting backward 	1	1	1
Fullback Mike Tolbert covered it for Carolina at the 45 — 1 yard shy of a first down 	1	1	1
After attempting unsuccessfully to draw the Falcons offside  the Panthers punted it away 	1	1	2
The Falcons took advantage 	1	1	1
The 37-year-old kicker made all three of his attempts against the Panthers  improving to 9 for 9 on the season 	1	2	1
Since joining the Falcons during the 2009 season  he has missed only eight of 79 tries 	1	2	1
Clutch  is how Ryan described him 	1	1	1
Charles Johnson spent so much time in the Atlanta backfield  he should've worn a Falcons jersey 	4	1	1
He was credited with 3½ sacks and hit Ryan five other times after he got the ball away 	1	1	1
If only Johnson could've gotten to him one more time — on that long pass to White 	3	1	1
I just heard the crowd  and when I got up I was kind of in disbelief  Johnson said 	4	1	1
"I couldn't believe what had happened	4	1	1
227 falcons-4-0-30-28-win-over-panthers-102848973--spt You know they were going to go deep  but that's one of the plays that we're going to have to learn from	3	1	1
227 falcons-4-0-30-28-win-over-panthers-102848973--spt I think it's either going to make us or it's going to break us	4	1	1
227 falcons-4-0-30-28-win-over-panthers-102848973--spt We'll see down the road "	4	1	1
Newton's fumble ruined what had been a stellar performance 	3	2	3
He threw for 215 yards  including a 17-yard touchdown to Greg Olsen early in the game  then a 36-yard scoring play to Kealoha Pilares that put the Panthers ahead 28-24 with 7:55 remaining 	1	1	1
Newton also ran for 86 yards on nine carries  bulling his way into the end zone from 4 yards out late in the third quarter 	1	1	1
The Panthers played much better than they did in their last outing  a 36-7 home loss to the New York Giants  but it wasn't enough to prevent them from sliding a daunting three games behind Atlanta in the NFC South 	2	2	2
I want to apologize to my teammates and the fans that were watching out there  Newton said 	1	1	1
"Everybody was doing their job	1	1	1
227 falcons-4-0-30-28-win-over-panthers-102848973--spt I clearly had the first down  but I've just got to hold onto the football "	2	1	1
NOTES: Michael Turner scored on a 60-yard screen pass  the first touchdown reception of his nine-year career 	1	1	1
He was beaten on both of White's touchdown receptions  missed a tackle on Turner's scoring play and had the ball snatched away by White on the long pass that set up the winning field goal 	1	1	2
    The Falcons travel to Washington next Sunday  while Carolina hosts Seattle 	1	1	1
Families of Libya's missing lead backlash against militias	2	1	3
"BENGHAZI  Libya (Reuters) - The face of a young man looks out from billboards across Benghazi  ""A mother's cry  If my son is guilty  bring him to justice  If he is innocent  let him go "" says the caption  which ends with a phone number "	1	2	3
Speaking at the family home  the mother  Ansaf Ibrahim  recounts how dozens of militia fighters from the February 17 Brigade stormed in on August 30 and seized her husband Ali Muftag al-Warfalli and their son Firas  21  a dentistry student 	2	1	3
The brigade  named for the start date of the revolution that toppled Muammar Gaddafi  is one of the largest and most heavily armed militias prowling Libya a year after the civil war ended  Most operate with the permission of the weak central government  They answer to their own leaders and maintain their own jails 	3	1	3
Such arrests  described by many Libyans as kidnappings  are fuelling a backlash  which has intensified in the days since the killing of U S  ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in an attack on the U S  consulate 	2	1	4
"Ansaf Ibrahim says a few people have called in response to the billboards but so far they have not been able to help  offering only sympathy  ""One person called to say his own mother fell sick with grief when she saw the billboards """	2	1	3
The militia say their powers to arrest and detain people are vital to protect a country where the police and security forces are too weak to maintain order 	3	2	2
February 17 says it has turned the two al-Warfalli prisoners over to the military police  A member of the brigade's High Security Committee said Ali Muftag  the father  was held on suspicion of having ties to Gaddafi loyalists in Egypt and Firas on suspicion of links to militants who set off bombs in Tripoli 	2	1	3
She believes her son was taken in just because he was at home when the militia arrived to arrest her husband  who was a student in Britain in the 1980s when pro-Gaddafi students inside the Libyan embassy were blamed for shooting a policewoman 	3	1	4
Whatever they think the father has done  that doesn't mean my son has done something too  If you want the father  you do not have to take the son in this horrible  frightening and savage way  she said 	2	1	3
Activists who speak out against the detentions say they frequently become targets too 	1	1	3
Journalist Sherifa al-Senoussi al-Fsay  who has criticized militia abductions in television broadcasts  was pulled off the street in May after leaving the home of a detainee's family  A car pulled up and armed men jumped out 	1	2	3
They took my bag and searched it  They saw my journalist ID  I was yelling  saying I was a journalist  she recalled 	1	1	2
I was trying to make them stop  One of them grabbed my veil  They tried to haul me away  I wriggled free and ran to a building  I tried to ask for help but one of the men grabbed me and dragged me across the ground  They took me to the car  threw me inside and beat me 	2	1	4
She says she was driven to a deserted spot and bundled into another car with another group of armed men  who also hit her 	2	1	3
Finally  she was delivered to a police station in central Benghazi  Activists demonstrated outside to demand her release and  after two days  a sympathetic militia leader sent armed men into the police station to free her 	1	3	1
The government says it is taking steps to rein in the militia  Those that operate without government permission are being dissolved  while those that have government permission are being incorporated into the regular army's chain of command 	1	2	1
The government said on Monday it was replacing the civilian leaders of February 17 and another powerful Benghazi militia that also operates its own jail  Rafalla al-Sahati  The leaders of the two militias  among the most powerful men in the country  are to be replaced with uniformed army colonels  putting their forces fully under the army chain of command 	2	2	1
The protesters seized bases of the Islamist militia Ansar al-Sharia  which did not have government permission and which Washington suspects of having had some kind of connection to the attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens 	1	1	3
The demonstrators then marched on the heavily fortified compound of Rafallah al-Sahati  one of the biggest militias that operate with government approval  The protesters looted the compound and freed prisoners  The authorities backed the militia the following morning and its base is again occupied 	1	2	3
Farm-state lawmakers returning home empty-handed	1	1	2
WASHINGTON (AP) — Farm-state members of Congress have campaigned for decades on the back of farm bills delivering election-season subsidies and other goodies to rural voters 	2	2	1
Not this year  The bill is stalled  primarily because House GOP leaders don't want a noisy fight over food stamps this close to the election  That poses a particular problem for some Republicans in tight races for the Senate or the House who will go home empty-handed when Congress adjourns this week 	2	1	2
Democrats are gloating 	2	2	1
Heitkamp and other Democratic challengers are using the farm bill as an example of how they say the Republican-run House is ineffective  Current farm law  which extends subsidy payments to farmers and pays for food stamps  is scheduled to expire Sept  30  with no new law in place for the first time in recent memory 	2	1	2
In addition to the effect on the North Dakota race  the failure to get a farm bill is affecting the Senate race in Montana and House races in Iowa  South Dakota  Colorado and Illinois 	2	1	2
Farm policy has traditionally been one of the more bipartisan issues on Capitol Hill  It still is  to an extent — the Senate in June passed the five-year farm bill with almost two-thirds of the chamber supporting it  A separate version passed the House Agriculture Committee in July with Republican and Democratic support 	2	1	2
Calling it a farm bill is something of a misnomer  Food stamps make up roughly 80 percent of the costs in both versions  The House would cut them 2 percent  angering many Democrats who don't want them cut at all and Republicans who say they should be cut more  The Senate version would cut them by one-half of 1 percent 	2	1	2
Since 2008  the food stamp program has more than doubled in cost  to $80 billion a year  driven by high  sustained unemployment  rising food prices and expanded eligibility under President Barack Obama's 2009 economic stimulus law  Food stamps now help feed roughly 46 million Americans  or 1 in 7 	1	1	2
It is unclear how angry rural voters will be about the lack of a farm bill  The farm economy has been strong in recent years  and expiration won't mean an immediate loss of benefits for most farmers  But farm-state members argue that the certainty of federal policy is necessary for farmers making their annual business plans this fall and approaching bankers for loans 	2	2	2
Punting the bill may also mean less money overall  While both chambers' versions of the bill would save tens of billions of dollars from current spending  the agriculture committees may be asked to save even more as budgets tighten further next year 	2	1	2
King and Berg — along with Republican House colleagues Denny Rehberg of Montana  Kristi Noem of South Dakota and others — have made repeated appeals to Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and other GOP leaders to bring the Agriculture Committee's bill to the floor before Congress adjourns this week 	1	1	2
The farm bill is far too important for too many Montanans to let election-year politics get in the way of doing the right thing  said Rehberg  who is in a competitive Senate race 	2	2	2
Noem  who is defending her House seat against Democrat Matt Varilek  said party leaders are hesitant to bring up a vote on a bill that they think might fail 	1	1	2
"Rep  Tim Huelskamp  R-Kan   said the legislation has turned into ""a food stamp bill"" that has bogged down because of both the presidential and congressional campaigns "	1	1	2
"There's not 218 votes to pass it  Huelskamp told reporters  ""It's going to be very tough to do that  even in a lame-duck session """	2	1	2
Though Berg  Noem  Rehberg and a handful of other Republicans signed it  a majority of the House is needed — unlikely when Republicans hold 240 seats to Democrats' 190 and after conservative groups came out against the bill as too expensive 	2	1	2
"Democratic Sen  Jon Tester of Montana  who is facing the challenge from Rehberg and is himself a farmer  calls the House's failure to take up the farm bill ""total craziness """	2	1	2
"It's going to have some pretty negative effects on agriculture if these people don't get off their butts and get it passed  he said in an interview  ""I am going to continue to try and talk some common sense into the House of Representatives """	2	1	2
Also getting criticism on the campaign trail for the farm bill's collapse are Republican Reps  Scott Tipton in Colorado and Rep  Bobby Schilling in Illinois 	2	1	2
The House in July passed a bill that would help livestock producers who are losing money because of a widespread drought  but the Senate has declined to take that up  with Senate Agriculture Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow saying that similar benefits are included in the larger bill  Republicans Rehberg and Berg have countered Democratic attacks by saying the Senate should consider that legislation 	1	1	2
Farthest Galaxy Yet Revealed by Cosmic Lens	1	1	1
This distant  ancient galaxy may have once helped clear out the murky fog that once filled the early universe  scientists added 	2	1	1
Astronomers estimate that the universe began about 13 7 billion years ago during the Big Bang 	1	1	1
One tool researchers can use to peer at these galaxies are so-called gravitational lenses  magnifying glasses resulting from the warped fabric of reality 	1	1	1
Gravity curves space-time  the greater the mass of an object in space  the stronger its gravitational pull 	1	1	1
This  in turn  bends light around it  affecting how telescopes on Earth view it 	1	1	1
Astronomers can gauge the age of an object by estimating its distance 	1	1	1
Since the speed of light appears the same throughout the universe  knowing how far away an object is reveals how long it took for its light to get here 	1	1	1
Astronomers have detected potentially older galaxies  but their faintness makes it difficult to make out key details regarding their age 	1	1	1
Such a discovery would not have been possible if the object was un-lensed  Zheng said 	2	1	1
"The age of this galaxy reveals it formed during the so-called ""epoch of reionization"" that occurred about 150 million to 800 million years after the Big Bang "	1	1	1
While caution should be exercised in the interpretation of a single object  the results presented in the Zheng paper point to significant star formation activity throughout this period 	2	1	1
Much remains uncertain as to what sources of radiation caused the epoch of reionization 	2	1	1
Since the researchers found this ancient galaxy after only monitoring a small patch of sky  Zheng said the early universe may have overall been rich with galaxies that drove reionization 	2	1	1
The scientists detailed their findings in the Sept  20 issue of the journal Nature 	1	1	1
Fed's $40 billion monthly MBS buys delivers maximum effect: Williams	1	2	1
Any more  he said  and market functioning could be disrupted because the Fed would dominate the purchases of new securities  any less  he said  would have less than maximum impact 	2	1	2
The U S  central bank this month said it would keep up its purchases of housing-backed assets until the labor market improves substantially  and would do even more if that standard is not met 	1	1	2
The Fed is also buying Treasuries in its Operation Twist program  in which the Fed buys long-term Treasuries and sells a like amount of short-term Treasuries 	1	1	1
"Saying he doubts there will be ""ongoing sustained and measurable improvement in a broad set of labor market conditions"" by the end of the year  Williams said the Fed will revisit its decision on the level of its monthly asset purchases at that time "	1	1	1
Judging improvement in the job market will require a look at the unemployment rate as well as jobs gains and overall GDP growth  he said 	1	1	1
"Fed's Evans: ""essential"" to do as much as we can now for economy"	2	2	1
"HAMMOND  Indiana (Reuters) - Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans on Tuesday reiterated his support for the U S  central bank's bold new push to lower borrowing costs and boost the so far ""disappointing"" recovery  and said the Fed should do even more "	2	2	2
"This was the time to act  Evans said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Lakeshore Chamber of Commerce Business Expo in the industrial Chicago suburb of Hammond  Ind  ""With the problems we face and the potential dangers lying ahead  it is essential to do as much as we can now to bolster the resiliency and vibrancy of the economy """	3	2	2
Evans' prepared remarks were the same he gave on Sept 18  less than a week after the Fed decided to embark on a third round of asset buying and said it would not let up until the outlook for the labor market had improved substantially 	3	3	1
The central bank also said it would keep short-term interest rates near zero until at least mid-2015  even after policymakers expect it to show signs of strength 	2	2	1
To boost the impact of its actions  the Fed should explicitly say that it will be just as tolerant of inflation running slightly above its 2-percent goal as it is about inflation running slightly below  Evans said 	2	2	2
U S  core inflation has run below 2 percent since 2008 	1	1	1
Unemployment  at 8 1 percent  is well above the 5 5 percent to 6 percent that many economists believe is normal for the economy in the long run 	1	1	1
We should not be resistant to policies that could move the unemployment rate closer its longer-run level  but run the risk of inflation running only a few tenths above our 2 percent goal  he said 	2	2	2
The Femininity Factor	3	1	1
"Are Republican women politicians more ""feminine"" than Democratic women politicians?"	2	1	1
"That's the conclusion of a new study by UCLA researchers  who found that Republican women are so much more ""feminine"" that college students were able to accurately predict party affiliation just by looking at the woman "	2	1	1
Neither did Sarah Palin  whom most men I know (but fewer women) consider to be very attractive 	1	2	2
The authors also point out that being feminine isn't necessarily a positive for women  since studies have found that people tend to think of women as either feminine or competent  but not both 	1	1	2
My own review of the studies  over the past 20 years  suggests that the issue is far more nuanced 	4	1	1
Some years ago  a woman who was passed over for a promotion at a Big Eight accounting firm brought suit for gender discrimination after she was told that changing her hairstyle and dressing in a more feminine style might improve her chances the following year 	1	1	2
Her claim that this amounted to sex discrimination was upheld by the Supreme Court  which means that no one says things like that anymore  much less writes them down 	2	2	1
But do they think it?	1	1	1
Absolutely 	5	1	1
I remember an article from a few years ago in which women CEOs were interviewed  and every one of them  literally  was pictured in pastel colors 	1	1	1
So cheerful and non-threatening 	4	2	1
For women seeking top positions  the challenge is to appear feminine  but not too feminine  assertive  but not too aggressive  attractive  but not too sexy 	3	1	1
My women students openly admit that they dress for interviews like dates  hoping to look their best: makeup  high heels  a well-fitting suit that shows off their figure 	1	1	1
And I always tell them to make sure to wear a shirt under the suit jacket 	1	1	1
Form fitting  yes 	3	1	1
One year  a group of my students went to a local mall  showed pictures of women they had clipped from a magazine to shoppers and asked them which one they thought was a CEO and which a sales clerk 	1	1	1
The one who looked like a model was thought to be neither  the gal with the pleasing features and short blond bob was the CEO  the overweight woman was the store clerk 	1	1	1
Big surprise 	4	1	1
The writer's point (helped along by his rather skewed choice of pictures) was how much better looking the Republicans were 	4	1	1
I don't claim to be a beauty  but I've never seen a worse shot of myself 	5	1	2
I don't know whether the UCLA students would consider Nancy Pelosi to be feminine 	1	1	1
I do 	5	2	1
Geraldine Ferraro?	1	1	1
Absolutely 	5	2	1
Who would even ask that question about a woman who has been a role model for young women of all political persuasions  a woman who is admired around the world?	4	3	1
"The fact that serious academics would conduct such a study  and that it would be published in a peer-reviewed journal  gives me pause — and not so much about them (such studies are apparently part of a burgeoning field of research called ""social vision "" which is not limited to women's facial features)  but about the fact that we continue to look at leadership this way "	3	1	2
The researchers note that it may be that Republican women's faces are more traditionally pretty because conservatives are more bound by gender stereotyping 	2	1	1
"Interestingly  they found Democratic men to be more masculine than Republican men  but considered this finding to be ""less revealing"" for reasons that the press release  at least  did not explain "	2	1	1
The fact that looks play a role in politics is nothing new 	2	1	1

Not necessarily  Although it's true that early research on fish oil seemed far more promising—one 1999 trial  for instance  reported that people who took omega-3 pills were 10 percent less likely to have a heart attack  stroke or die from cardiac disease than people who did not—some researchers think that recent negative findings reveal more about us than they do about fish oil  Omega-3 pills may be beneficial for certain people but not for others  they say  and existing studies may not account for individual differences 	1	3	2
There's no question that polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids—the technical name for the good fats found in fish and fish oil—are important parts of a healthy diet  Our bodies can't make them  yet we need them to survive  as they form part of our cell membranes  Although the mechanism by which they might prevent heart disease  cognitive decline and depression isn't well understood  research suggests that they reduce blood pressure and inflammation and that they increase brain blood flow and give neurons structural strength 	1	3	2
"And no one questions the World Health Organization's recommendation (pdf) that pregnant and nursing women should consume at least 300 milligrams of omega-3s daily to boost fetal brain development  ""That [benefit] has been clearly demonstrated in trials "" says Dariush Mozaffarian  a cardiologist and epidemiologist at Harvard University  who studies fish oil "	2	3	1
"But for other adults  the health benefits of supplementing have become much harder to gauge  That's in part because many of us get lots of these good fats from our diet anyway: According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization  per capita fish consumption has doubled (pdf) since 1961  and ""more consumption doesn't really add much bang for your buck "" Mozaffarian says  In other words  adding more omega-3s to an already omega-3–rich diet does not do much good  a fact that could help explain why recent studies have been more equivocal than studies from several decades ago  when fish was less popular  ""We have no evidence from populations whose dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids may be low and who may therefore benefit from supplementation "" says Alan Dangour  head of the nutrition group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and co-author of the recent Cochrane review  In addition  preliminary research suggests that certain ethnic groups—such as Japanese and Italians—may benefit more from omega-3 supplements than others  perhaps in part because of how well their bodies absorb the fats "	2	2	2
"Another potential problem is that most of the research on fish oil and heart health—including all of the trials included in the recent JAMA analysis—have involved subjects who already have heart disease or established risk factors  Whereas this isn't necessarily a problem in itself  it means that very little research has addressed whether fish oil supplements benefit healthy people  ""The jury is still out on whether omega-3 supplements can prevent a first cardiovascular event in people at usual risk "" says JoAnn Manson  an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who is conducting a trial to answer this question  which she estimates will be finished in 2016 "	1	1	3
"Moreover  because so many trials have involved subjects with heart problems  subjects in recent years have been ""taking multiple medications  such as aspirin and statins  which can obscure the effects of supplements "" Manson says  (Half of the studies included in the JAMA analysis were conducted after statins became commonplace ) This fact could also help explain the outcome discrepancies between recent trials and older ones carried out during the pre-statin era  Indeed  a February 2012 analysis of a large European clinical trial reported that fish oil supplements do not prevent second heart attacks among people taking statins  but that it cuts risk by half among people who don't take the medications  (Because there were so few non-statin users enrolled in the trial  this finding did not quite reach statistical significance )"	1	2	3
"People who enroll in and complete omega-3 trials may differ from typical Americans in important ways  too  ""Members of the public who volunteer to join randomized controlled studies are frequently healthier and more active than the average for the population "" Dangour says  which could affect outcomes in unknown ways  In addition  he adds  people who drop out of trials are often the sickest  and they might be the ones who would most benefit from supplementation "	2	2	3
There's also more than one type of fish oil  Typically  in omega-3 intervention studies  subjects take pills containing a near-equal mixture of two fats  docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)—but some research suggests that in certain situations and for certain outcomes  one may be better than the other  For instance  a 2011 meta-analysis concluded that fish oil capsules don't help treat depression  but a group of British and Norwegian researchers challenged these findings  citing evidence that pills containing at least 60 percent EPA do seem to provide mood benefits  Another controversial question is whether the omega-3 dose is important in and of itself or whether the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fats one consumes is more important  (Although omega-6 fats are important for survival  Americans tend to consume far more of these fats than they need )	1	2	2
"Finally  whereas the recent JAMA analysis concluded that fish oil has no effect on cardiovascular outcomes  the researchers did find that omega-3s reduced the risk of cardiac death by 10 percent  an effect that was statistically significant (having a ""p value"" of 0 01)  The researchers did not report the finding in their conclusions because they subsequently modified their statistical calculations to account for the fact that they had used the same data set to ask a number of different ""exploratory"" questions: In this case  does fish oil prevent heart attacks? Strokes? What about sudden cardiac death? The team wanted to tighten their definition of statistical significance to account for the fact that the more questions one asks  the more likely one is to get a positive result by chance  Still  Mozaffarian says  ""if you combine all the data and look only at cardiac death  there is a statistically significant benefit  A 10 percent reduction in the number-one cause of death in both men and women in the U S  is a big deal """	2	4	1
"If you don't eat fish  then the question of what to do becomes more difficult  Researchers argue that  ultimately  we need more randomized  controlled clinical trials on omega-3 supplements—particularly in healthy people who don't take medications—but these are becoming rare  in part because the supplements will never be big moneymakers  ""Generic fish oil is available  so drug companies don't have any strong motivation to fund trials "" Mozaffarian says "	3	1	2
Five ways Romney can still win	2	1	1
I first began to write this post on September 12  the day when Mitt Romney was supposed to don the fall collection of campaign clothing and start new and fresh 	4	1	1
Gallup's tracking has provided the only comfort data for Boston  so perhaps that's a place to start 	3	2	1
Romney has high hurdles ahead of him 	2	1	2
Some combination of the following events and contingencies will have to intrude upon the race for him to do so  but a Romney/Ryan administration remains within the realm of possibility 	2	1	1
Keep in mind: there WILL be natural tightening (as opposed to the political Botox kind) between now and election day 	2	1	1
1  Romney has a stellar first debate  which galvanizes his campaign and allows late-breaking independents to finally see the man that Ann Romney so loves dearly 	3	3	1
Likelihood: 60 percent 	2	1	1
Debate 1 is about domestic policy  and the economy is lackluster 	2	1	1
If ever there was a time to step up and force Barack Obama to explain to the American people just what he would do to create jobs -- if ever there was an opportunity to refocus the campaign back onto the jobs issue -- it's on October 3 at the University of Denver 	3	1	2
Jim Lehrer  the moderator  is not going to throw anything Romney's way that he hasn't already anticipated 	2	1	1
2  Romney has a human moment 	1	1	1
Likelihood: 40% 	2	1	1
But he is so cautious on the campaign trail  so full of anxious energy  that even his scripted soft moments come off as somewhat silly 	3	1	2
So he needs someone to give him a bear-hug  or to shed a genuine tear  or to tell a dirty joke -- something entirely spontaneous that expands the comfort zone 	3	2	1
From the start  the Obama campaign has tried to portray Romney as too darn unusual to be the president  and that strategy has worked 	1	1	1
Clint Eastwood's talking chair routine is not going to cut it 	2	1	1
"You can hear my eyes roll in their sockets as I type words like ""humanizing moment "" but the incumbent here is much more of a fully formed character than the challenger  and for people who haven't made up their mind  that matters "	5	1	1
Likelihood: 30% 	2	1	1
The more Democrats think they're going to win  the more enthusiasm their base will have  and the easier it will be for Obama to get to 270 electoral votes on the strength of only marginal independent turn-out 	2	2	1
Romney needs to someone juice the game to scare Democrats into thinking that they're going to lose  which will set the ball rolling in the opposite direction 	3	1	1
Campaign cues  even what ridiculous anonymous strategists whisper to reporters  matter a lot 	4	1	1
Voters pick up on them 	1	1	1
4  Iran does something stupid and dangerous  Israel attacks Iran unilaterally 	3	1	3
Likelihood: 40% 	2	1	1
This is a huge unknown  and it's unseemly to speculate about anything that would involve death and destruction 	2	1	3
But the moment Americans become uncomfortable with the way their commander-in-chief handles foreign policy crisis is the moment the challenger can step in with a better solution 	2	1	2
Unfortunately  Romney has been fairly vacuous when it comes to foreign policy in general 	3	1	2
5  The Medicare argument works 	1	2	1
Likelihood: 10% 	2	1	1
President Obama's $716b Medicare     call it an adjustment     remains a viable political opportunity for Romney  albeit a very risky one 	2	2	2
Though the Affordable Care Act cuts payments to hospitals and to private insurers that subsidize special add-on plans to Medicare (Medicare Advantage)  it could well persuade a number of doctors to stop accepting Medicare in the first place 	2	1	2
Eventually  the market will even out access  but in the short term  there is a grain (but just a grain) of truth in what the Republican ticket likes to say about Medicare 	2	1	1
Ignoring the larger truth that Romney-Ryan's plan does a lot more damage to the product  enough scared seniors could swing states like Florida  Iowa  Nevada and Wisconsin 	2	1	3
That has reality-based Republicans scared out of their wits 	2	1	2
It has others  like Tim Pawlenty  scrambling for the exits (gracefully) 	2	1	1
For now  the rest can only grin and bear it 	3	2	2
Ford execs tout Fusion  Mulally stays mum on succession	2	1	1
NEW YORK/DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co dispatched its top brass  including Chief Executive Alan Mulally  to major U S  cities on Tuesday to promote the 2013 Fusion  its redesigned family sedan that takes aim at Toyota Motor Corp's <7203 T> Camry 	1	1	1
Ford hopes the third-generation Fusion  coupled with the new Escape crossover launched this spring  will boost its U S  market share 	1	2	1
Ford is also cutting costs in Europe  where it expects to lose more than $1 billion this year 	1	1	3
Ford's sales in Europe fell 29 percent in August  while overall industry sales dropped 8 5 percent 	1	1	2
There is a tremendous decrease in demand  but we're absolutely committed to Europe  Mulally said at a Fusion event in New York 	2	1	2
But on Tuesday  Mulally kept a lid on the finer details of Ford's plans for Europe and his own plans for retirement 	2	1	1
Please don't vote me off  he joked to reporters 	3	1	1
"Under Mulally's ""One Ford"" plan  Ford is moving toward building more cars using fewer platforms  a move that cuts costs but allows Ford to offer more features at a lower price "	1	2	1
The Fusion is the latest Ford car to receive a global overhaul  after the Fiesta subcompact and Focus compact car 	1	1	1
The Fusion will be sold as the Mondeo in Europe and China 	1	1	1
These models share about 75 percent of the same parts 	1	1	1
Through August  sales in this bread-and-butter segment have risen 26 percent  while overall auto sales are up 15 percent  Ford said 	2	2	1
This is a transformational vehicle for our company  J Mays  Ford's chief creative officer  said Monday night at an event in Miami Beach 	1	1	1
The base model of the revamped Fusion will cost $21 000  the same as the base price of the outgoing Fusion  Mays said 	1	1	1
Ford is offering three gasoline-powered versions of the Fusion as well as a hybrid and a plug-in hybrid 	1	1	1
In a press release  Ford said the Fusion hybrid gets 47 miles per gallon on the highway and in the city  beating out the Camry hybrid 	2	2	1
"At the New York event with American Idol host Ryan Seacrest  Mulally held a sign touting the ""47"" figure "	1	1	1
Ford also passed out T-shirts with the Fusion hybrid's fuel economy figures 	1	1	1
Boosting fuel efficiency has been a pillar of Ford's vehicle strategy for the past six years 	1	2	1
Ford must also meet federal government's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) target of 54 5 mpg by 2025 	1	1	1
This translates to 36 mpg or higher in real world driving  analysts say 	1	1	1
The average fuel economy of Ford's cars and trucks for model year 2011 was 21 3 mpg  up from 18 mpg in 2006  U S  government data shows 	1	1	1
Ford plans to cut weight from future models by using lightweight materials 	1	1	1
Ford is also designing and making key electric-drive components in-house to cut costs and accelerate development of these technologies 	1	2	1
Buyers of the 1 6-liter Fusion with a turbocharged engine can purchase the $295 auto start-stop system  which shuts the engine off when the car is stopped at a light 	1	1	1
Ford is looking to provide this option in a larger number of its vehicles 	1	1	1
The Fusion can also parallel park itself  with the active park assist feature 	1	1	1
That's been a key point in our turnaround and our success  we've really pushed on being a technology leader and making sure we bring those technologies to the mainstream  Nair said 	2	2	1
Former Employee Explains Why He Was Fired From Facebook	1	1	1
Getting fired sucks 	5	1	2
Noah Kagan has lived through that experience 	1	1	1
"On Saturday  the AppSumo founder decided to write about his ""$100 million dollar lesson"" learned  detailing why he was terminated six years ago "	1	1	2
Kagan joined Facebook as a product manager in November 2005  and was fired eight months later in June 2006 	1	1	2
When he left  the social network was still limited to high school and university students 	1	1	1
Facebook started accepting anyone with a valid email address in September 2006 	1	1	1
He described the reasons for his dismissal like this: He was selfish  accidentally leaked company secrets to TechCrunch and didn't address his weaknesses as a product manager 	2	1	2
"I wasn’t great at planning or product management at this time	3	1	2
242 former-employee-explains-why-fired-facebook-192903368 Fix them or move to another position  Kagan wrote "	1	1	1
The serial entrepreneur worked exceptionally well as an employee in a 30-person company  but had a hard time adjusting as Facebook grew to 150 employees 	2	2	2
"He described himself as a ""show-er"" at Facebook or ""someone who can be good for the company where they are now  but NOT where they are going """	3	2	2
Growers  or employees who can grow with the company and adjust to changes  are the ones who are successful  he said 	1	1	1
While at Facebook  Kagan admits he used the company's name too much for his own personal gain 	1	1	1
Kagan suggests the key to success is being a humble employee  listening during group collaboration meetings and being mindful of how you can improve as a part of a team 	3	2	1
Constantly ask yourself how can I make the company more valuable  he wrote 	2	1	1
You do that and you will never get fired  unless you do something really stupid or the company goes out of business 	3	1	2

Four arrested over wave of kidnappings in Mozambique	1	1	2
MAPUTO (Reuters) - Mozambique police have arrested four men accused of running a kidnapping ring behind more than 20 abductions in the capital Maputo in the past year 	1	1	2
The alleged ring-leader  Bakhir Ayoob  is the son-in-law of Mohamed Bachir Suleman  a wealthy businessman in the city 	2	1	1
Wealthy Muslims have been the main targets of the kidnappings  which began in November 	1	1	2
All those abducted were released after ransoms were paid 	1	1	2
When a 17 year-old girl was kidnapped last month  Muslims in the city threatened to strike in protest at what they said was a lack of government action 	1	1	2
Police detained Ayoob  30  at his home early on Friday 	1	1	2
He is the highest-profile suspect of 20 men arrested in connection with the kidnappings 	1	1	2
The abductions are part of a wider crime wave targeting wealthy foreigners who have moved into Maputo on the back of a flood investment into the southern African nation's vast coal and natural gas reserves 	1	1	3
A new study on the genomics of breast cancer confirms that there are four distinct genetic types of the disease  suggesting that some drugs already used to treat cancer in other parts of the body could possibly be used to treat certain forms of breast cancer that share the same genetic abnormalities 	2	1	1
The researchers  whose findings were published Sunday in the journal Nature  studied the DNA of breast cancer tumors of 825 patients at various stages of the disease  and found that the disease could be stratified into four major genetic categories 	1	1	1
The new study  part of the largest breast cancer genomic project  offers the largest pool of data for researchers who have known for decades that there were genetic subtypes of breast cancer 	1	1	1
This again reconfirms on a larger scale the heterogeneity that exists between each patient's breast cancer  said Dr  Ben Park  associate professor of oncology at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins 	2	1	1
Park was not involved in the study 	1	1	1
We now understand the recoding of the genome that is behind [these cancers]  said Dr  Matthew Ellis  a professor of medicine at Washington University in St  Louis  and a researcher on the study 	2	1	1
In particular  researchers found that one type of the disease  more commonly known as triple negative breast cancer  genetically resembles a form of ovarian cancer that is currently treatable 	1	1	1
Triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive and deadly form of the disease that responds to chemotherapy but has high rates of relapse 	1	1	3
But clinicians caution that it will take years for these initial genetic findings to change the course of treatment for breast cancer  which is expected to kill nearly 40 000 women in 2012  according to the American Cancer Society 	2	1	2
You would need to treat a large number of patients with this profile to see whether the hypothesis works  said Dr  Jay Brooks  chairman of the department of hematology and oncology at Ochsner Clinic Foundation and Hospital in Baton Rouge  La 	2	1	1
According to many breast cancer experts  the findings confirm that cancers should be defined and treated according to their genetic components rather than their location in the body 	2	1	1
"For a lot of physicians  breast cancer is breast cancer is breast cancer	2	1	1
245 four-distinct-genetic-types-breast-cancer-study-finds-173049395--abc-news-health And the problem is  it isn't  said Brooks "	2	1	2
Certainly breast cancer patients will want to know whether this study leads to a different clinical approach to the management of their disease  and for now  this is not the case  said Brooks 	3	1	1
For now  the genomic information offers researchers a more definitive understanding of breast cancer  and hope that once the specific type is identified in a patient  a clinician can  eventually  offer an arsenal of personalized treatments 	1	2	1
Without the ability to understand the various types  we are not able to develop personalized medicine to treat them or develop ways to effectively prevent them  said Lillian Shockney  administrative director of the Breast Center at Johns Hopkins 	2	1	2

France drops rape investigation into ex-IMF head Strauss-Kahn	1	2	3
LILLE  France (Reuters) - France's public prosecution service said on Tuesday it was shelving an investigation into allegations that disgraced former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn  a man once tipped to become president of France  had engaged in group rape 	2	2	3
The prosecution service said in a statement it had taken the decision after a young woman retracted an allegation against the 63-year-old  who is also fighting wider accusations of sexual misdemeanor in France and a civil case in the United States 	3	2	3
Strauss-Kahn's legal team welcomed what amounted to a partial victory for their client  who has asked a court to end a wider French inquiry into sex parties organized out of the northern city of Lille 	2	2	2
This is a common sense decision  Richard Malka  a lawyer for Strauss-Kahn  told i>TELE television 	2	2	1
The fight goes on 	2	1	1
Strauss-Kahn was about to announce he would run for the French presidency when police arrested him in May 2011 in New York after a hotel maid alleged he had tried to rape her 	2	2	3
New York prosecutors dropped those charges  citing concerns about the credibility of the accuser  but hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo is now pursuing him in a civil case and his legal battles have piled up since his return to France 	2	2	3
In the so-called Carlton Affair  named after a luxury hotel in the northern French city of Lille  investigators are trying to establish whether Strauss-Kahn participated in sex parties to a degree that amounted to actively encouraging prostitution 	2	1	4
Having sex with prostitutes in France is not illegal but pimping is 	1	1	3
France  Germany to seek common position on EADS-BAE	1	1	1
After talks on a tie-up between EADS and Britain's BAE Systems were leaked last week  government officials from across Europe have this week been setting out their views on the deal 	1	1	1
"A ""pre-decision"" for a common position with France could be taken at these preparatory talks  one source said "	2	1	1
A combination of BAE and Airbus owner EADS would overtake U S  rival Boeing as the world's biggest aerospace and defense company in terms of sales 	1	1	1
Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government has not yet come up with a unified position on the talks  though some German politicians want guarantees for German jobs and to see some activities being headquartered in Germany 	2	1	1
It cannot be that a Franco-British company is created out of a Franco-German company  Joachim Pfeiffer  a spokesman for Merkel's CDU party told Reuters on Wednesday  saying that he would not accept it if the merged company based its commercial activities in Toulouse and its defense operations in London 	2	1	1
EADS employs almost 50 000 people in Germany at 29 different sites 	1	1	1
"German media reports this week that EADS boss Tom Enders offered job guarantees to the group's 20 000 defense workers have been dismissed as ""nonsense"" by officials and by EADS "	1	1	1
In the state of Bavaria  where EADS employs 15 000 people  the regional economy minister said a merger might improve the firms' competitive position but his focus was on securing jobs 	1	1	1
Keeping jobs and technology expertise within Europe's largest economy should be a key factor for the government in deciding whether to approve the deal  a politician from the German opposition Social Democrats said on Wednesday 	1	1	1
There seems to be some advantages  Hubertus Heil told a German radio station  adding that the government should make an unbiased review of the economic benefits 	2	1	1
One of the benefits for EADS in joining with BAE is that it would dissolve a cumbersome shareholder pact dictating that the percentage of shares held by German and French investors must be equal 	2	1	1
"For Britain  the key is to ensure that the creation of a European group would not affect BAE's strong sales in the United States  which have benefited from the ""special relationship"" between the two countries "	2	2	1
If the deal goes ahead it would open up new prospects for Europe in the defense market  Elisabeth Guigou  head of the French parliament's foreign affairs committee  told Reuters 	2	1	1
"She added though that completing such huge merger deals was ""not easy"" and that negotiations would likely take a long time "	3	1	2
"EADS and BAE have said they will offer the governments of France  Germany and Britain a ""golden share"" in the new company  which sources say is aimed at preventing a hostile takeover "	2	1	2
Currently  Berlin does not hold a direct stake in EADS  but is in talks to acquire a 7 5 percent holding from carmaker Daimler through state development bank KfW 	1	1	1
These talks have now stalled  a German government source told Reuters 	1	1	1
However  if France holds on to its stake in a merged group  then Germany would likely strive for the same 	2	1	1
France's Muhammad cartoons: Will they divert anger away from the U S ?	1	1	1
"A French satirical magazine  Charlie Hebdo  has published several offensive caricatures of Islam's Prophet Muhammad  threatening to fuel outrage in the Muslim world first sparked by an obscure anti-Islam film made in the U S  The Parisian weekly had intended to mock the violent response to the video  with a cover featuring ""an Orthodox Jew pushing a turbaned Muhammad in a wheelchair and the headline: 'You must not laugh '"""	2	1	2
Now  the French government fears the cartoons will only give rioters an excuse to turn their rage on French embassies after a week of attacking American diplomatic posts  including the U S  Consulate in Benghazi  where Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed 	2	1	2
France has ordered its embassies and schools closed in 20 countries on Friday  the Muslim prayer day  which often serves as an occasion for large protests 	1	1	2
Will the French cartoons  seen as blasphemous by many Muslims  shift the focus of the riots onto France  or merely provoke renewed attacks on the U S ?	2	1	2
So thanks for that  Charlie Hebdo 	2	1	1
The magazine should have known what was coming — its offices were firebombed last year after publishing cartoons ridiculing Islam 	2	1	2
"The French government is trying to prevent the worst by ""clamping down on protest "" but  if recent history is any guide  that won't stop extremists from taking a swipe at their new target ""France's"	2	1	2
"turn?"""	1	1	1
There's still plenty of heat on the U S : Judging by the first demonstrations after the cartoons came out  says Agence France Presse  the U S  is not off the hook 	2	1	1
Protesters in Lebanon  for instance  are certainly angry over the French cartoons  but  if anything  the rage they're focusing on the U S  has only intensified 	2	1	2
"Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah  leader of the Islamist group Hezbollah  even went so far as to call the film blamed for triggering the riots  Innocence of Muslims  ""the worst attack ever on Islam """	3	1	3
Hezbollah supporters demonstrate in Tyre  warn U S  and France	2	1	1
The entire West is the target  and always was: Closing embassies won't spare France  says David Frum at The Daily Beast 	1	1	1
The people who instigate these protests seek a very particular goal: an extension of Egyptian and Pakistani style blasphemy laws into the West 	2	1	2
"France can't budge on this  nor can the U S  ""The right to ridicule religion"" is one of things that defines a free society "	2	1	1
"We'll both be targets as long as we refuse to act as the ""local censorship police for the Egyptian state """"The"	2	1	1

LYON  France (Reuters) - A French centenarian will try to ride his way into the record books on Friday by becoming the fastest cyclist of his age to cover 100 km (62 miles) 	1	2	1
At nearly 101 years old  Marchand claims to have covered hundreds of thousands of kilometres on his bicycle during his lifetime and said he plans to cover the distance at a speed of 22 5 km/h 	3	2	1
"If I make it  I'll become the best in the world  said Marchand  who turns 101 in November  ""I know that all over the world  in China  in the United States  in Russia  they're already looking for someone to beat my record """	3	3	2
Marchand lives alone  drives a car  makes his own meals and cleans his apartment with no help  The wiry centenarian says he never smoked  but otherwise indulged a healthy appetite for wine and women throughout his life 	1	3	1
His uncommon vitality has piqued the interest of scientists at the Inserm public research institute  who examine Marchand every three months to try to understand the secret to his longevity and well-being 	1	3	1
"They told me I had the constitution of a 55-year-old man  they think it's genetic  he said  laughing  ""I have never deprived myself of anything: not wine  not food  not women  but always with moderation """	2	3	1
"Asked if he planned to get any performance-enhancing help for his race  Marchand said: ""The only doping for me is water with a spoonful of honey that I put in my canteen - and that's it """	2	1	1
If I was doping  though  maybe I could hit 35 km/h 	1	2	1
French Muslim leader urges calm as Mohammad cartoons republished	1	1	1
PARIS (Reuters) - The main agency representing Muslims in France appealed for calm on Friday as a new print run of cartoons featuring a naked Prophet Mohammad hit newsstands  raising fears of protests on prayers day around the Islamic world 	1	1	2
French embassies  schools and cultural centers were shut in some 20 Muslim countries  on orders issued from Paris after the cartoons were first published 	1	1	1

"Mohammed Moussaoui  leader of the French Muslim Council (CFCM)  described both the film and the cartoons as ""acts of aggression"" but appealed to French Muslims not to take to the streets for wildcat protests "	3	2	2
Charlie Hebdo  an anti-establishment weekly whose Paris offices are under police protection  defied critics to rush out another run of the publication that caused outrage and sold out in minutes last Wednesday 	3	1	2

A new crowdfunding platform that focuses solely on video games launched Tuesday morning  and offers gamers a chance to invest in titles vetted by a team of industry experts 	1	2	1
Gambitious functions like a donation-based platform  such as Kickstarter 	1	1	1
It allows people living in the European Union and eventually the U S  to invest equity into games  and receive returns on their investment 	1	2	1
Unlike Kickstarter or IndieGoGo  however  Gambitious doesn't let just anyone submit a project for funding 	1	1	1
Gambitious founders Mike Wilson and Harry Miller say they are worried about the future of crowdfunding for games  and want to make sure potential backers don't get burned out 	1	1	2
He previously worked at companies such as id Software  Gathering of Developers and Gamecock Media Group 	1	1	1
Much of this Kickstarter gold rush has to do with developer Double Fine's uber-successful campaign to make a point-and-click adventure game 	1	1	1
The company raised $3 3 million back in February  and Kickstarter has said seven of the first 10 projects to reach the $1 million funding goal were game-related 	1	1	1
Miller says quick success has given independent developers big dreams  but adds that they may not have the ability or money to fulfill them all 	1	2	2
Many costs that crop up later surprise the developers  he says  such as marketing  or even creating special rewards for Kickstarter backers 	1	2	1
"Every little thing costs money	1	1	1
253 gambitious-crowdfunding-gamers-only-043008954 It hurts them terribly in the end  when they didn't plan for it "	1	1	2
Cosmic DJ is one of the titles looking for funding at Gambitious' launch 	1	1	1
It's a unique music-tablet game that challenges players to try and create better music than their friends 	1	1	1
Matt Piersall  who is working on the game  says that when the developers realized they needed funding  Kickstarter didn't seem like a great option 	1	1	2
It's really hard to get noticed on Kickstarter  and it's a full-time job of the developer to make sure the campaign runs smoothly  he says 	1	1	2
With Gambitious  Wilson and Miller say their goal is to make sure smaller developers  especially first-timers  understand what they are getting into  while also making sure the game's consumers can donate or invest in a basic business plan  at minimum 	1	1	1
It's not to say that a team of inexperienced people can't do this  but we want to make sure they have a plan  Wilson says  adding that Gambitious already has contracts with marketing  public relations  voice acting and music services 	1	1	1
The duo will soon have another group to educate: potential investors 	1	1	1
Investors on Gambitious can only invest in the game the company is making -- not the developers themselves -- but they can still get returns if a game sells well 	1	2	1
"The average age for a gamer each year goes up  now it's near 40	1	1	1

253 gambitious-crowdfunding-gamers-only-043008954 Why not invest in something that you're passionate in? Wilson says "	1	1	1
Gambitious launched seven projects from around Europe and the United States  with plans to add more 	1	2	1
Wilson says he expects to see a big push when investment opportunities open to the U S  For now  anyone outside the EU can use the site in the same way they would any other crowdfunding platform 	1	2	1
While developers may find the application more stringent than other crowdfunding sites  Wilson says he hopes they will see the reasoning behind it 	1	2	1
"We ask them to create a business plan to go with their project	1	1	1

Gangnam Style hit doubles value of Psy's father's stock	1	1	1
"SEOUL (Reuters) - A pop star whose song ""Gangnam Style"" became the first Korean hit to top Apple's music download charts has also worked his magic on his father's software firm  helping it double in value since singer and dancer Psy burst onto the global scene in July "	1	3	1
Psy's father  Park Won-ho  is the chairman and controlling shareholder of South Korean semiconductor company D I Corp and its market capitalisation has surged to 113 5 billion won (62 4 million pounds) on the main Seoul bourse  making it as of Tuesday the 459th most valuable stock measured by size 	1	1	1
"Psy's ""Gangnam Style""  which mocks the rampant consumerism of a rich Seoul suburb  went viral on video-sharing website Youtube "	2	2	2
The video has been viewed more than 267 million times on Youtube since it was released in mid-July 	1	1	1
The positive sentiment from 'Gangnam Style' has attracted investors just because of the fact that the company is owned by Psy's father and uncle  said Lee Sun-tae  a researcher at NH Investment and Securities  who added Psy is not a shareholder in the company 	2	2	1

Georgian president concedes but democracy rules	2	2	1
TBILISI  Georgia (AP) — Defying expectations  President Mikhail Saakashvili conceded Tuesday that his party had lost Georgia's parliamentary election and his opponent had the right to become prime minister  setting the stage for political turmoil in the final year of his presidency 	3	1	3
The new Georgian government will be led by billionaire businessman and philanthropist Bidzina Ivanishvili  who made his fortune in Russia and until recently was little known to the 4 5 million people in his homeland on the Black Sea 	1	1	1
In one notable accomplishment  it was the first time in Georgia's post-Soviet history that the government changed by the ballot box rather than through revolution  Saakashvili came to power through the peaceful Rose Revolution after a rigged parliamentary vote in 2003 	3	3	2
By conceding defeat even before the results of Monday's election were released  the 44-year-old Saakashvili defied the opposition's expectations that he would cling to power at all costs and preserved his legacy as a pro-Western leader who brought democracy to the former Soviet republic 	3	3	2
He also prevented potential violence on the emotionally charged streets of the capital  Tbilisi  where support for the opposition Georgian Dream coalition is strongest  Opposition supporters began celebrating as soon as the polls closed  and the mood could have turned ugly very quickly if they thought they were being deprived of a victory 	3	3	3
The 56-year-old Ivanishvili  meanwhile  went immediately on the attack  Speaking at a televised news conference  he declared that most of the president's widely praised reforms were a joke and said Saakashvili had deceived the Americans into believing he was a democrat  He then called on Saakashvili to resign 	3	1	3
"I don't think our political battle was caused by any personal antagonism on my part toward Saakashvili  he said  ""But I have always blamed Saakashvili for what has gone wrong in Georgia  and I can repeat that today: This man's ideology has established a climate of lies  violence and torture """	4	1	4
During his nearly nine years in power  Saakashvili has pushed through economic and political reforms and attracted international investment that has led to dramatic economic growth  Poverty and unemployment  however  remain painfully high 	3	3	3
Saakashvili's campaign was also hit hard by the release two weeks ago of shocking videos showing prisoners in a Tbilisi jail being beaten and sodomized  The government moved quickly to stem the anger  replacing Cabinet ministers blamed for the abuse and arresting prison staff  but many saw the videos as illustrating the excesses of his government 	3	3	5
In his televised concession speech  the president said there were deep differences between his party and the diverse opposition coalition 	2	1	1
"We think their views are completely wrong  he said  ""But democracy works through the majority of the Georgian people making a decision  and we respect this very much """	3	2	3
Saakashvili will remain as the leader of Georgia until his second and last term ends in October 2013  Under a constitutional reform that goes into effect after he leaves office  many of the president's powers will be transferred to the prime minister  who is chosen by Parliament 	1	1	1
Alexander Rondeli  a Georgian political analyst  said the antagonism between Saakashvili and his future prime minister threatened to create a political storm 	3	1	3
"Both the president and Ivanishvili have stated  not very willingly  but they have stated their readiness to work together  Rondeli said  ""But on Ivanishvili's team are people who  metaphorically speaking  want Saakashvili's head  Whether he will be able to resist their influence only time will tell """	3	2	4
"Saakashvili was under pressure to hold a democratic election and prevent the kinds of violations believed to have boosted his results in the past  This message was reinforced by U S  Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton during a visit in June  when she told him that the ""the single best thing Georgia can do to advance your security  your prosperity  your democracy  your international reputation  is to hold free and fair elections that result in a fully democratic transition """	2	3	3
"More than 400 international observers monitored the election  They expressed concern over the harsh rhetoric during the campaign and isolated cases of violence  but said Tuesday the election process had showed ""a healthy respect for fundamental freedoms at the heart of democratic elections """	3	3	3
Ivanishvili has confirmed his commitment to pursue Saakashvili's goals of making Georgia an integral part of Europe and member of NATO  while adding he will seek to restore the trade and diplomatic ties with Russia that were severed when the two countries fought a brief war in 2008 	1	3	3
Georgian producers of wine  mineral water  vegetables and fruits had depended on exports to Russia  and the closing of those markets hurt them deeply 	2	1	3
We talked about the future  how to develop our relationship with our big friend (the United States)  and how to develop democracy in Georgia  he said after meeting with Republican Sen  James Risch of Idaho and Democratic Sen  Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire  both members of the Foreign Relations Committee 	3	3	1
In Russia  where the election was being watched closely  the government welcomed Saakashvili's defeat  He and Russian President Vladimir Putin have had a deep enmity since the 2008 war that left Georgia battered 	3	3	3
"Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said the opposition victory would bring ""more constructive and responsible"" people to parliament  He said the Kremlin political party was ""ready for dialogue about the future of Russian-Georgian relations """	4	4	1
Alexei Malashenko  a scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center  was more cautious 	2	1	2
For a while  ties will soften  there will be a prospect of improvement  but an exchange of embassies is not possible yet  he said 	2	2	2
One of the main obstacles is the status of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia  which Russia has recognized as independent  Georgia lost its last remaining territory in both provinces as a result of the 2008 war and bristles at the Russian troops stationed there 	1	1	3
German  French leaders to discuss EADS  banking union	1	1	1
BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande will scrutinize plans by EADS and BAE Systems to form an aerospace and defense giant on Saturday but are unlikely to give final go-ahead to a merger fraught with economic and security concerns 	2	1	2
Airbus-maker EADS is anxious for stakeholders France and Germany to set out their position on the merger  and has warned that if Berlin and Paris's approval is tied to too many conditions it could abandon the proposed $45 billion union 	2	1	3
Under British stock market rules  EADS and BAE have until October 10 to announce whether they will go ahead 	1	1	1
A German government spokesman said on Friday no decisions were expected during the leaders' working lunch in Ludwigsburg 	2	1	2
Sources familiar with discussions say that without a clear political direction it is unlikely the companies will be ready to present a detailed plan in time for that deadline and it is increasingly likely they will seek an extension 	3	1	2
Executives of both firms are engaged in a hectic charm offensive directed at political leaders  but investors fear a lack of synergies and that heavy state interference could hamstring the future company 	2	1	3
The political message coming out of the Franco-German meeting will be closely watched in Britain  where sources close to BAE have signaled it will not go ahead with the deal if governments are able to interfere in the day-to-day management of the enlarged company 	2	1	2

Each time there has been a change in the Franco-German leadership couple there have been teething problems  but each time the different personalities have found a way to work together  said a senior French diplomat 	2	3	2
I think their relationship has developed well  they've made an effort to get on after so many warned of trouble ahead  said Ulrike Guerot at the European Council on Foreign Relations 	2	3	2
De Gaulle  who in the 1960s withdrew France from NATO's military command  symbolized French efforts to have its own defense capability with an industry to match 	1	2	1
Safeguarding jobs  a source of past Franco-German conflict in EADS  will feature highly at Ludwigsburg which is just a few hours' drive from a dozen EADS sites ranging from a helicopter maintenance firm in Baden Baden to a radar developer in Ulm 	1	1	2
Bringing together our defense industries so as to have an industrial base for defense which  in Europe  would allow us to take on the international competition is a necessity if we want to have a meaningful European security and defense policy 	2	2	1

On the ECB's new bank oversight remit  Germany's view that this should be limited to systemically-relevant and cross-border institutions falls far short of the European Commission's more extensive proposal  which is backed by Paris 	2	1	1
Giving the ECB a bigger role is part of the euro zone's efforts to provide a long-term fix for its sovereign debt crisis  providing better supervision and safeguarding bank stability in sovereign states that get into difficulties 	2	2	2
"French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said on Wednesday he saw room to bridge differences on the timing and the scale of the reforms  calling it ""simplistic to characterize this as some kind of clash"" "	3	2	2
"Claire Demesmay at the German Council on Foreign Relations said bank oversight reform mattered greatly to the French leader who sees it as ""a symbol for more integration and solidarity without having to give up national sovereignty"" "	2	2	1
France also sees this as a step on the way to achieving more commonality  after the idea of Eurobonds failed  she said 	2	2	2
German  French leaders say stronger Europe needed	2	1	1
BERLIN (AP) — The leaders of France and Germany both stressed Saturday that Europe must further deepen its political and economic integration to ensure peace and continuous prosperity across the continent 	2	2	1
French President Francois Hollande met Chancellor Angela Merkel in the southwestern German city of Ludwigsburg to celebrate an important anniversary of their countries' reconciliation following the end of World War II 	1	2	1
France and Germany have a very special responsibility  we form the heart of Europe  said Hollande  adding that the European Union's status quo can only be seen as the starting point for a deeper integration 	3	1	1
"Stopping would mean falling back	3	1	2
258 german-french-leaders-stronger-europe-needed-130713706 We don't have a choice  but to march toward the destiny that is ours  march toward a unified Europe  he added "	3	1	2
"Europe's 17-nation currency zone is experiencing a deep crisis  Hollande said  therefore urging Germany and other nations to help ""create instruments that make us stronger: the budgetary union  the banking union  the social union  a political union """	3	2	3
Merkel said both countries will and must work together closely to strengthen Europe to weather those new challenges 	2	1	1

France's then-leader Charles de Gaulle in 1962 addressed German youth in Ludwigsburg — speaking in German — in a speech that was hailed as a major step toward building German-French ties  after the nations had fought each other in both world wars  and were often referred to as arch-enemies 	2	1	2
"They were convinced that ""natural enmity between people could not exist "" she added "	3	2	1
The two countries' rapprochement evolved to become a motor of Europe's integration less than two decades after World War II 	1	2	1

"Germany sets up neo-Nazi register after ""shameful"" murders"	3	1	4
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany launched a national register of neo-Nazis on Wednesday as it takes steps to tackle failings that allowed known extremists to wage a seven-year racist killing spree 	1	1	3
The discovery of a small neo-Nazi cell in the former East German town of Zwickau last year and evidence linking it to the killings caused profound shame in Germany and highlighted its shortcomings in fighting right-wing extremism 	1	1	3
The existence of the cell  calling itself the Nationalist Socialist Underground (NSU)  only came to light by chance after two members committed suicide following a botched bank robbery  and a female accomplice torched an apartment used by the gang 	1	1	3
Germany plans an overhaul its intelligence services in the wake of the NSU murders  but some experts say what is needed most is a fundamental change in approach in a country whose Nazi past makes right-wing militancy a sensitive subject 	1	1	2
"The new database will be of use  but it doesn't help with the fundamental problem which is that this data must be properly scrutinized  and immediately investigated	3	2	2
259 germany-sets-neo-nazi-register-shameful-murders-195425430 The fact this didn't happen is what led to the catastrophic failures  said Hajo Funke  an expert on Germany's far-right "	2	1	2
Underestimating the far-right threat is a long running trend  he said 	2	1	2
Since late last year a depressing picture has emerged of missed chances and missed leads as the group engaged in a killing spree from 2000-2007  murdering eight Turks  a Greek and a German policewoman 	3	1	4
Authorities hope the new register will ensure intelligence on far-right extremists is properly shared between the police forces and domestic intelligence services across German states 	2	2	1
The register is modeled on a database of radical Islamists that has been in operation for several years 	1	1	1
However obstacles faced by an inquiry into the killings show that progress may be difficult 	2	1	2
In July the head of Germany's domestic intelligence service resigned after admitting that an official within his agency had shredded files on the NSU 	1	1	2
This week Berlin's Interior Senator expressed regret for not sharing with the inquiry that an informant of the Berlin Office of Criminal Investigation had warned years earlier that he had information about the NSU 	2	1	2
Chancellor Angela Merkel  who has apologized to the families of the murder victims for the catalogue of neglect and errors  said on Monday the inquiry was not proceeding as it should 	2	1	2
Experts say far-right extremism is a particular threat among disenchanted young people in Germany's eastern regions where unemployment is high 	2	1	2
Police have reopened all unsolved cases with a possible racist motive since 1998 amid fears that security services underplayed the far-right threat  or used unreliable informants 	2	1	2
Germany's top mail-order pharmacy files for insolvency	1	1	2
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Sanicare  Germany's largest mail-order pharmacy  has filed for insolvency due to problems that have arisen following the recent death of its founder and head  the company said on Wednesday 	1	1	3
A statement said the insolvency was for the mail-order pharmacy activities of the company and would not affect the rest of Sanicare's businesses  which include the online unit 	1	1	1
Buenning said the insolvency has arisen due to complexities of the company's organizational structure as well as uncertainties surrounding the will of Moenter  who died on September 4 	1	1	2

Golf-South Africa secures rights to big-money event for 10 years	2	2	1

Golf-U S rookies slip into Ryder Cup shadow on last day	2	1	2
MEDINAH  Illinois  Sept 30 (Reuters) - Three of the four American rookies who seized the Ryder Cup spotlight with their fearless play slipped into the shadows during the decisive singles on Sunday  as Europe claimed a shock victory 	3	2	3
Webb Simpson  Brandt Snedeker and Keegan Bradley became instant Ryder Cup darlings with their dazzling debut in the opening foursomes and fourballs on Friday but were mostly invisible on Sunday as Europe stormed back from a 10-6 deficit to take the trophy 	3	2	3
The first-timers  who had formed the backbone of the American's 5-3 first day lead and made significant contributions on day two  failed to deliver in the last day pressure cooker with Jason Dufner the only rookie to record a win beating Sweden's Peter Hanson two up 	2	3	3

How Google became the world's second most valuable tech company: 4 theories	3	2	1
The search giant has enjoyed a strong run in recent months — share prices are up 30 percent for the quarter — and has now overtaken Microsoft's $247 27 billion market capitalization  clocking in at one point with a $248 89 billion market cap of its own 	3	2	1

"2  Microsoft's software business has been battered""The PC hardware business is obviously struggling "" Martin Pyykkonen  an analyst at Wedge Partners Corp   tells Bloomberg "	2	1	2
Although the company still gets most of its revenue from Windows and Office software  sales have slumped as more consumers turn to Android tablets or iPads to handle their home computing needs 	2	1	2
Simply put: Customers are looking to the Cloud  not the disk drive 	2	1	1
"3  Microsoft has yet to prove it can go mobileWindows 8 is set to debut later this month  and while the new operating system ""is designed to be Microsoft's first to translate tidily from PCs to smartphones and tablets  Microsoft has spent years failing to prove it gets mobile "" says Marcus Wohlsen at Wired "	2	1	2

Google seen taking Facebook's crown in U S  display ads	1	1	1
Google's rising clout in display ads - the boxes with images and video found on websites -- has come on the back of growth in video advertising on its YouTube subsidiary  as well as mobile advertising through Admob  a company acquired by Google in 2009 	1	2	1
But it added that publishers across the board have been bruised by weaker-than-expected display advertising demand this year as large brands withheld splurging on costly digital campaigns 	2	1	3

Google works to improve Web-based rival to iOS 6 Maps	1	2	1
If the New York Times’ report from Tuesday is accurate  a native Google (GOOG) Maps app for iOS might not be released until the end of the year 	2	1	2
For the time being  it would appear iOS 6 users can either switch to Android  deal with the issues until Apple fixes them or visit Google’s mobile Maps website for their mapping needs 	2	1	2
The Web-based solution is not ideal and it’s much slower than a dedicated app  but using Google’s Maps website in Safari or any Web browser is still more accurate than Apple’s hot new mess 	3	2	3
It just doesn’t have Street View  Google’s huge database of stitched panoramas taken from camera-outfitted cars 	2	1	2
According to a New York Times published on Thursday  however  Google will update its mobile Maps website with Street View within two weeks  bringing iOS users an even more robust alternative to the widely criticized Apple Maps app 	2	3	3
Gout Attacks Are the Pits    Eating Cherries May Help	3	2	3
If a doctor diagnoses that crushing pain in your big toe as gout  relief just might be a bowl of cherries 	3	2	4
A new Boston University study has found that eating about 30 pieces of the sweet fruit within 48 hours of a gout attack may cut the risk of recurrence of the painful arthritic condition by 35 percent 	2	3	1
Though anecdotal evidence of gout-healing powers of cherries has been circulating since the 1950s  lead author Yuqing Zhang  professor of medicine and public health at Boston University  said he believed this was the first study to indicate that cherry consumption does indeed reduce gout flare ups 	3	3	1
In the study  633 gout patients were followed online for one year and monitored for their gout symptoms  medications and risk factors as well as their intake of cherries and cherry extracts up to two days before a gout flare up  Eating up to three servings of cherries – about one and a half cups – appeared to be the magic number for preventing a gout attack 	3	2	1
However  further cherry intake did not provide any additional beneficial effect  Zhang said 	2	1	2
More than 8 3 million Americans suffer from the disease  Men  especially older obese men  are the most susceptible though a woman's risk increases after menopause  In earlier studies  Zhang and his team showed that alcohol consumption  a high protein diet and foods such as shellfish which are rich in the chemical purine can also up gout frequency 	1	1	4
The secret behind cherries' gout-fighting powers isn't entirely understood  Dr  Allan Gelbar who co-wrote the commentary to the study in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatism with Dr  Daniel Solomon  said it could be the vitamin C content of the fruit or perhaps the anti-inflammatory effect of their high antioxidant content 	1	2	1
Zhang said one limitation of the study is that it relied on the accuracy of each participant's recall of what they did and ate in the 48 hours before a gout attack  The next step would be to do a trial where some gout sufferers ate cherries while others did not 	1	1	2
Gelbar said that anyone who suffers from gout should consider adding cherries to their diet as a preventative measure but shouldn't stop taking their medication  Patients in the study who ate cherries and also took the uric-acid reducing drug  allopurinol  lowered their risk of gout recurrence by up to 75 percent 	2	3	1
And  although the study also found cherry extract was useful for lowering the number of gout attacks  the researchers stressed that the sample size – only 15 people – was too small to draw definite conclusions  The FDA has sent a letter to various cherry-based product manufacturers warning them not to use the study results to make claims about the benefits of their products 	1	1	3
Grand Jury Indicts Colorado Man on Vacation Investment Scheme	1	1	1
According to Denver District Attorney Mitchell R  Morrissey  a grand jury has indicted a man today of using more than $8 million of investor money for his personal use 	2	1	2
* A Denver Grand Jury returned a 20-count indictment against Brian Wellens  42  the district attorney stated 	2	1	2
Wellens was charged with violating the Colorado Organized Crime Control Act  two counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and 17 counts of securities fraud 	1	1	3
* An arrest warrant has been issued for Wellens 	1	1	2
* Morrissey stated that the indictment was the result of a joint investigation with the Colorado Division of Securities 	2	1	1
* According to the charges  Wellens allegedly took approximately $8 5 million from 19 different investors between 2006 and 2011  promoting vacation investment through his company  Continental Resort Homes 	2	1	2
* Instead of using the investment money to purchase vacation properties  the district attorney reported  Wellens allegedly used the money for his personal expenses and other businesses 	2	1	2
However  he never acquired the site or started construction on that home 	2	1	2
* According to the Gazette  some of the creditors in his bankruptcy included state House Majority Leader Amy Stephens (R-Monument)  state Rep  Bob Gardner (R-Colorado Springs)  Colorado Lottery Director Abel Tapia  Vladamir Jones Chairman Nechie Hall and former Colorado Springs entrepreneur Ron Muns 	2	1	1
* The violation to the Colorado Organized Crime Control Act is a class 2 felony which carries a penalty for up to 48 years in prison and up to $1 million in fines  according to the Felony Guide for Colorado 	2	1	2
The conspiracy charges are class 4 felonies  calling for two to 12 years in prison and up to $500 000 in fines 	1	1	2
Group claims Da Vinci painted early Mona Lisa work	1	1	1
GENEVA (AP) — A Zurich-based foundation says it will prove to the world Thursday that Leonardo Da Vinci painted an earlier version of the Mona Lisa 	2	1	1

Guatemalan massacre suspect extradited to US	1	1	3
LOS ANGELES (AP) — A former Guatemalan soldier accused of being involved in a brutal 1982 massacre during that country's civil war has been extradited to California where he faces immigration fraud charges 	1	1	4
"Authorities allege Sosa was a member of a Guatemalan military unit known as the ""kaibiles"" and helped command a unit assigned to track down suspected guerrillas who had stolen military weapons "	1	1	2
Guatemala's civil war claimed at least 200 000 lives before it ended in 1996 	2	1	4
Gunmen attack Kenya police post near Somali border	1	1	3
GARISSA  Kenya (Reuters) - Gunmen attacked a Kenyan police post on Monday in the northern town of Garissa close to the border with Somalia  police and residents said  a day after two police officers were shot dead in the same town 	2	1	4
We have just received reports of the attack  security personnel have been dispatched to the scene  Garissa county commissioner Mohamed Maalim told Reuters 	2	1	3
Residents of Garissa said an explosion  followed by gunshots  were heard on the street where the small police post is located 	2	1	2
'HabCam' Opens Unique Window on Seafloor Life	1	1	1
The oceans are getting the red-carpet treatment with a new project from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution: HabCam  an optical imaging endeavor that provides researchers with a one-of-a-kind glimpse of the seafloor 	2	2	1
"The ""Cam"" part of HabCam is a camera system that is towed over the ocean bottom along the continental shelf (where a continent drops off under the ocean) off the East Coast of the United States "	1	1	1
The system snaps six images per second — that's a half-million images per day  then  a process corrects the color and an algorithm stitches the pictures together to create a giant panorama of the seafloor 	1	1	1
Each day  HabCam can capture 100 nautical miles (185 kilometers) of ocean floor 	1	1	1
Amber York  a biology research associate at Woods Hole who works on HabCam  told OurAmazingPlanet that pictures have already sparked her interest: She has spotted an anemone and a worm that could be new species 	1	2	1
As a biologist  I think what excites me more than anything about this project is the ability to see these organisms in a large scale in their natural habitat  York said 	1	2	1
Zigzagging over the seafloor	1	1	1
HabCam's 2-megapixel camera is towed on a large metal skeleton by a 103-foot (31 meters) sea scallop trawler  above coastal regions of the Northeast  including Georges Bank  the Mid-Atlantic Bight  and the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary 	1	1	1
To collect the photos  HabCam is towed from a ship and travels in patterns from zigzags to spirals through the ocean about 6 to 8 feet (1 8 to 2 4 m) above the seafloor  collecting more than 40 million images in total 	1	1	1
The newest version of the system also includes a side scan acoustics system that gathers information on seafloor roughness — something that is difficult to see with the photos alone 	1	1	1
The pictures also give scientists a window into how marine life on the seafloor acts 	1	1	1
In the past  biologists have used giant trawlers to scoop up critters and dump them on the deck of ships for analysis 	1	1	1
The problem  York said  is that the creatures look different when they come up than they do in their natural habitat 	1	1	1
They may change their color as they come up  or they get broken up too much in the process  she said 	2	1	2
For example  sea stars were thought to be relatively spread out  but York has noticed that they tend to gather in armies — she calls them hordes — and eat everything in their path as they move across a scallop field 	2	1	1
Counting scallops and sea stars	1	1	1
The camera is helping scientists count scallops on the seafloor  and helping them understand the health of the ecosystem 	1	2	1
Right now  it's being used to count scallops in a way that is much more rigorous than previous methods 	1	1	1
They want to create a quantifiable marker for the habitat  including factors such as species richness  diversity  the composition of the material the creatures live on  and ecosystem change through time and over different areas 	1	1	1
HabCam will help create an historical baseline for the seafloor health to be evaluated in the future 	1	2	1
Of course  it's a lot of work sifting through all those images 	1	1	1
"To help  those running HabCam have reached out to the Citizen Science Alliance and launched an interactive website called ""Seafloor Explorer "" where people can help identify scallops  sea stars and other creatures in the pictures "	1	2	1
The project is starting with 100 000 images to annotate 	1	1	1
We are interested in finding out what is happening to the seafloor over time  but we also need help in identifying individuals in all the photos  York said 	1	1	1
The research group is working on a system to train computers to classify the images  but first they need people power to interpret what they're seeing 	1	1	1
York is positively pumped over the future of the field 	2	2	1
I think this is just the start of a whole field of research — imaging of marine life on the seafloor  she said 	2	2	1
The Maps application in iOS 6 is disappointing to say the least  and while Apple (AAPL) may be on a hiring spree to fix the problem  one iOS hacker has taken matters into his own hands 	2	1	2
Ryan Petrich on Sunday posted a video that demonstrates the original Google Maps program from iOS 5 running on iOS 6  Petrich revealed that he would like to release the hack to the public  however it is not yet stable enough to do so 	2	1	1
As expected  it is required that users have a jailbroken iPhone running iOS 6 for the port to be successful 	2	1	1

A History of Religious Hoaxes	1	1	2
"The trailer for the film ""Innocence of Muslims"" recently led to riots over its depiction of the prophet Muhammad as a womanizer  child molester and criminal  Several Americans  including U S  Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens  were killed in protests that have been linked to the film "	1	1	5
"Despite the outrage it's not clear that the film actually exists  certainly a trailer for it does  but a trailer isn't a film  Investigation into the anti-Muslim ""film"" is ongoing  but as yet there seems to be no evidence that the film exists other than as a deadly hoax  People create hoaxes for many reasons  but when fraud mixes with religious fervor the results can range from the comical to the deadly "	2	1	3
Here's a look at seven religious hoaxes throughout history 	1	1	2
1  The Protocols of the Elders of Zion	1	1	1
"Perhaps the most infamous and malicious religious hoax in history  ""The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion"" is a book supposedly revealing a secret Jewish conspiracy to take over the world  It first appeared in Russia in 1905  and though the book has been completely discredited as a forgery  it is still in print and remains widely circulated Many people have endorsed this religious hoax  including actor Mel Gibson  Adolf Hitler  and automaker Henry Ford  who in 1920 paid to have a half-million copies of the book published  [Top 10 Conspiracy Theories]"	3	1	4
2  The Shroud of Turin and Other Holy Relics	1	1	1
"When farm workers digging a well in Cardiff  N Y   uncovered a fossilized man in 1869 they found something remarkable  The Cardiff Giant  as the figure became known  was a somewhat realistic figure with roughly human dimensions — except that it was nearly 10 feet tall  It was clearly something unique — but what exactly it was divided the public  Some believed it was a stone carving  but who would have made it so long ago that it was buried so deep in the ground? Others  including a local reverend  were convinced it was proof of the literal truth of Biblical scripture  specifically Genesis 6:4 (""There were giants in the earth in those days"" KJV)  Here  finally  was one of those Biblical giants  discovered on a rural New York farm! It was in fact a clever hoax by a man named George Hull who had planted the carved stone where it would later be found by the farm hands  partly to prove the Bible literalists wrong "	2	3	2
4  Indian Guru Sai Baba's Legerdemain	1	1	1
One of the most influential spiritual leaders in India  Satya Sai Baba died last year at the age of 84  For over five decades the charismatic guru enthralled and mystified followers by performing minor miracles  including producing holy ash  watches  statues  necklaces and rings seemingly out of thin air  However  skeptical investigators including Basava Premanand of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations accused Sai Baba of simple magicians' tricks  and pointed out that all the objects were small and easily concealed in his hands and long-sleeved robes  In at least one case Sai Baba was caught on film by British investigator Professor Richard Wiseman secretly pulling small objects from his person while pretending they appeared out of nowhere 	3	3	3
"Those seeking to find archaeological and historical proof of events in the Bible have often looked for — and  some claim  even found — Noah's Ark  Though many claims of finding the ark are honest mistakes  in 1993 a man hoaxed CBS television into running atwo-hour primetime special titled ""The Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark "" It featured a man named George Jammal  who claimed to have found the ark on a mountain in Turkey  As proof of his incredible claim  he proudly displayed a piece of wood from the ark  it was in fact scrap pine marinated in soy sauce  and Jammal was an actor who had never even been to Turkey "	1	2	2
"In 2002 an antiquities dealer in Israel claimed to have discovered a limestone ossuary (used to hold bones of the dead) with an inscription in Aramaic on one side of the box identifying its (missing) contents as those of ""James  Son of Joseph  Brother of Jesus "" The find made international news because if genuine  it might provide archaeological evidence for Jesus Christ  However many archaeologists were skeptical for several reasons  including that there was no clear provenance (history) for the item and because carved rosette patterns on the other side of the box were rounded from age and decay  while the script on the disputed inscription had sharp edges suggesting it was recently added  A chalk wash also appeared to have been added to the lettering to make it appear older than it actually was  In 2003 the Israeli Antiquities Authority published a report concluding that the inscription was a modern forgery carved on a genuinely old ossuary box  [Faux Real: A Gallery of Forgeries]"	2	2	3
7  God Speaks to Peter Popoff Via Short-Wave Radio	1	1	1
"In 1986  magician James ""The Amazing"" Randi heard about Popoff's amazing abilities and decided to investigate  Randi noticed an apparently minor detail that most people missed: Popoff was wearing a hearing aid or earpiece  Using a radio scanner  Randi discovered that Popoff was actually getting biographical information about audience members from his wife (who had earlier spoken to the audience) using a short-wave radio  The scandal tarnished Popoff's ministry  but he eventually recovered and remains active today "	2	2	3
'Homeland' and 'Modern Family' win big at Emmys	1	2	1
"LOS ANGELES (AP) — ""Homeland "" which puts the battle against terrorism on American soil  was honored as best drama series at Sunday's Emmys and earned trophies for stars Claire Danes and Damian Lewis  ""Modern Family"" was named best comedy "	2	2	1
"We feel so lucky  lucky not only to have jobs in these challenging times  but to have jobs that we love with people we love  said Steven Levitan  co-creator of ""Modern Family """	2	3	1

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A study of nearly 190 000 young women injected with Merck & Co's human papillomavirus vaccine Gardasil found no new safety concerns 	1	2	1
Researchers said the only side effects they observed - rare cases of skin infections and fainting - were benign and expected 	2	2	1
This analysis was very reassuring  said lead researcher Dr  Nicola Klein of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in Oakland  California  whose work was funded by Merck 	2	2	1
HPV vaccination is recommended for both boys and girls to shield them from the sexually transmitted infection  which may cause various types of cancer 	1	1	1
While Gardasil has already been deemed safe and effective by health regulators across the globe  large follow-up studies are typically required after vaccines hit the market to make sure less-common side effects haven't been missed 	1	1	1
Klein's team studied girls and women ages 9 to 26 who had had at least one Gardasil shot between 2006 and 2008 	1	1	1
Based on electronic records  they compared ER visits and hospitalizations soon after vaccination and several months later  when short-term side effects would no longer be expected to show up 	1	1	1
U S  health regulators have found no serious side effects apart from soreness at the injection site 	1	1	1
At first glance  several health conditions appeared to be linked to the vaccination  including seizures  allergic reactions and birth defects in vaccine recipients 	1	1	2
A special safety committee without ties to Merck concluded that most of these conditions were not truly caused by the vaccine  however  but rather unrelated or preexisting conditions detected when the shot was given 	1	1	1
"All of a sudden these things get brought up again  said Klein  ""but it has absolutely nothing to do with the vaccination """	2	1	1
In the two weeks after getting the vaccine  there were 1 8 cases of skin infections per 10 000 women  compared to just one case per two weeks per 10 000 women months away from the vaccination 	1	1	1
But again  the risk was very low and has been seen before in other vaccine studies  Klein said 	2	2	1
It's possible that fainting may be a stress reaction to the injection itself  according to Dr  Michael Brady  an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus  Ohio 	2	1	1
He said adolescents should sit down for 15 minutes after getting a shot  as also advised by health officials 	2	1	1
If they do fall and hit their head it can have consequences  so it's not something to be ignored  added Brady  who was not involved in the new work and has no ties to HPV vaccine makers 	2	1	1
Gardasil is expected to prevent more than 90 percent of genital warts and between 60 and 70 percent of cervical cancers  according to Dr  Christopher Harrison of Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics in Kansas City  Missouri 	2	2	1
The risk benefit here is clearly and resoundingly in favor of the vaccine being much more beneficial than risky  said Harrison  who was not linked to the new study and has not had any relationship to Merck for the past three years 	2	2	1
HTC has launched a new flagship Android device  the HTC One X+  which is basically a refresh (albeit quite a thorough one) of its powerful HTC One X device 	2	3	1
When we reviewed the HTC One X in May 2012  we called it one of the best Android devices out there  and though Samsung's Galaxy S III has grabbed a big chunk of its spotlight  the One X is still a very powerful beast 	3	3	1
So  what can HTC do to best that device?	1	3	1
Try a 1 7 GHz quad-core Nvidia Tegra 3 processor  64GB of internal storage  and a 2 100 mAh battery 	2	3	1
This monster combo should make the HTC One X+ up to 67% faster than its predecessor  along with giving it up to 6 hours (50%) more talk time 	2	4	1
Alongside with One X+  HTC is also launching the latest version of its Sense UI  Sense 4+ 	1	2	1
"This means the new flagship will also have several nifty software improvements  including ""Tap and Go"" pairing with Beats speakers and a self portrait camera mode "	2	3	1
HTC is also launching HTC Get Started  a new web service that lets users easily set-up and personalize their mobile experience from a desktop web browser 	1	2	1
As far as availability goes  the One X+ will be available in Europe and North Asia from October and in South Asia from November 2012 	1	1	1
HTC One S and X owners will be happy to know that they'll also get the Sense 4+ update starting October 	2	2	1
Huge X-Wing-Like Cargo Ship Undocks from Space Station	2	1	1
28)  ending a six-month delivery flight to the orbiting lab 	1	1	1
The robotic Automated Transfer Vehicle 3 (ATV-3)  with its four X-wing-like solar arrays unfurled  cast off from the space station Friday as the two spacecraft sailed 255 miles (410 kilometers) over western Kazakhstan in Asia 	2	1	1
The cargo ship's undocking occurred at 5:44 p m  EDT (2144 GMT) 	1	1	1
The space departure occurred three days later than planned due to delays  first by a computer glitch and later by space junk near the space station 	1	1	2
It will spend the next few days orbiting Earth before being intentionally destroyed on Tuesday (Oct 	1	1	2
Today  everything has worked to perfection  NASA spokesman Rob Navias said during the agency's live broadcast of the undocking 	2	3	1
The ATV-3 spacecraft was built by the European Space Agency and delivered 7 2 tons of food  water and other vital supplies to astronauts aboard the International Space Station when it launched in March from a South American spaceport in Kourou  French Guiana 	1	1	1
The ATV-3 spent 184 linked to the space station before being packed with trash and other unneeded items for its eventual fiery demise in Earth's atmosphere 	2	1	2
The ATV-3 is ESA's third unmanned cargo ship mission to visit the space station  which is also supplied by robotic cargo ships from Japan and Russia 	1	1	1
In the United States  NASA has contracted two companies — SpaceX of Hawthorne  Calif   and Virginia-based Orbital Sciences Corp  — to provide unmanned cargo delivery flights to the station 	1	1	1
The first official flight by SpaceX is scheduled to launch on Oct  7  when the company	1	1	1
The ATV craft are huge cylinders 32 feet long (10 meters) and nearly 15 feet wide (4 5 m) and may be visible by observers on Earth as a bright moving light in the night sky  weather permitting 	2	1	1
The ATV-3  like the International Space Station  can be spotted if you know where to look 	3	1	1
To find out if the ATV-3 will be flying over your location  visit one of these websites and enter the information for your location:	3	1	1
The European Space Agency is also holding a photo contest for satellite trackers hoping to snap a photo of the ATV-3 as it orbits the Earth during the next few days 	2	1	1
Prizes will be awarded for the best snapshots 	1	2	1
We look forward to seeing any and all photos of ATV in free flight and we wish you happy snapping for the contest! ESA officials said in blog post 	2	2	1

Human rights activist arrested by Algerian police	1	1	3
ALGIERS  Algeria (AP) — A member of a leading human rights organization has been beaten and arrested in a southern Algerian city 	2	1	3
The lawyer for Yacine Zaid said Tuesday that his client had been punched and beaten by police when they arrested him at a road block in Ouargla   700 kilometers (435 miles) south of the capital 	3	1	4
The lawyer  Sidhoum Mohamed Amine  said Zaid was arrested Monday on the ground that he had shown a lack of respect for police 	3	1	3
"The paper quoted an eyewitness  Abdelmalek Aibek Eg Sahli  a representative of a hotel union  as saying that Zaid ""wasn't aggressive and I don't see why he is accused of that """	2	1	2
"Amine said in an interview with The Associated Press that police often use ""verbal aggression"" to justify an arrest "	2	1	2
He was detained in Algiers on Sept  25 after a support rally for another human rights militant on a hunger strike  but later released 	1	2	2
Human rights court rejects extradition appeal by UK Islamist	1	1	1
PARIS (Reuters) - The European Court of Human Rights on Monday gave final approval for one of Britain's most radical Islamist clerics  Abu Hamza al-Masri  to be extradited to the United States with four others to be tried for terrorism 	1	1	3
The Egyptian-born cleric filed an appeal  along with the four other suspects  after the court in Strasbourg authorized Britain to transfer him to the United States on charges that he supported al Qaeda and aided a fatal kidnapping in Yemen 	1	1	3
"Al-Masri  54  could face a sentence of over 100 years in an ultra-secure ""Supermax"" prison  and had argued that such treatment would contravene Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights  which prohibits inhumane and degrading treatment "	2	1	3
The decision also concerned appeals lodged by four other defendants  Babar Ahmad  Syed Tahla Ahsan  Adel Abdul Bary and Khaled Al-Fawwaz  all of whom have been detained in Britain pending extradition to the United States 	1	1	2
A spokesperson for Britain's Home Office welcomed the outcome  adding that Britain would work to ensure that all five individuals were handed over to U S  authorities as quickly as possible 	2	2	1
Al-Masri is one of the most radical Islamists in Britain  where he was once a preacher at a North London mosque but was later convicted of inciting murder and racial hatred 	2	1	3
He is being held in a British jail 	1	1	1
He was indicted in 2004 by a federal grand jury in New York  accused of providing material support to al Qaeda and of involvement in a hostage taking in Yemen in 1998 in which four hostages were killed 	1	1	3
Will Humans Eventually All Look Like Brazilians?	1	1	1
It really happened: Six generations of inbreeding spanning the years 1800 to 1960 caused an isolated population of humans living in the hills of Kentucky to become blue-skinned 	2	1	1
The startlingly blue people  all descendants of a French immigrant named Martin Fugate and still living near his original settlement on the banks of Troublesome Creek when hematologists studied them in the 1960s  turned out to have a rare blood condition called methemoglobinemia 	2	1	1
A recessive gene was pairing with itself to change the molecular composition of their blood  making it brown as opposed to red  which tinted their skin blue 	1	1	1
The hematologists' attempt to trace the history of the mutant gene revealed a gnarly Fugate family tree  contorted by many an intermarriage between first cousins  aunts and nephews  and the like over the generations 	2	1	1
"Dennis Stacy  whose great-great-grandfather on both his mother's and father's sides was the same person — Henley Fugate — offered a simple explanation for the rampant interbreeding: In the old days in eastern Kentucky  Stacy said  ""There was no roads """	2	1	1
It sounds sordid at worst and lazy at best  but in fact  the Fugates' tale is a miniature version of the story of human coupling since time immemorial 	4	1	2
Local populations interbreed  causing a sharing of genes  a resulting in-group physical resemblance and  eventually  identification as a distinct race or ethnic group 	1	1	1
During the latter half of the 19th century  bikes upped the distance men went courting to 30 miles (48 km)  on average 	1	1	1
Scholars have identified similar patterns in other European countries 	1	1	1
Widespread use of bicycles stimulated the grading and paving of roads  lending credence to the Fugate clan's excuse and making way for the introduction of automobiles 	2	1	1
Love's horizons have kept expanding ever since 	3	1	1
Stearns says globalization  immigration  cultural diffusion and the ease of modern travel will gradually homogenize the human population  averaging out more and more people's traits 	1	1	1
Because recessive traits depend on two copies of the same gene pairing up in order to get expressed  these traits will express themselves more rarely  and dominant traits will become the norm 	1	1	1
In short  blue skin is out 	3	1	1
Brown skin is in 	3	1	1
Already in the United States  another recessive trait  blue eyes  has grown far less common 	1	1	1
The only explanation for the observed pattern that was consistent with the data (that we could think of) was that assortative mating had changed  Lauderdale told Life's Little Mysteries 	2	1	1
Assortative mating is the tendency of people to mate with members of their same ancestral group — a tendency that has seemingly lessened over time 	2	1	1
This was consistent with a birth year-related increase in the proportions of individuals who listed more than one ancestry in the 1980 census 	1	1	1
Lauderdale says blue eyes won't die out completely  they'll simply stabilize at a low level that reflects the chance of mating between two individuals possessing recessive blue-eye genes 	2	1	1
Because most immigrants to the U S  are from Asia  Africa or Latin America  any trait that is more common in northern Europeans than in the rest of the world will get less common over the near future in the U S  due to immigration  McDonald wrote in an email 	1	1	1
"Examples would include red and blond hair  blue eyes  and freckles 	1	1	1
291 humans-eventually-look-brazilians-140349518 Traits that are recessive and are more common in some groups than others will decrease due to blending  blue eyes  sickle cell anemia  and cystic fibrosis are examples of this "	1	1	1
Meanwhile  many other physical traits will simply blend together 	1	1	1
Most of the traits that we think of as distinguishing different groups (hair color  skin color  hair curliness  facial features  eye shape) are controlled by multiple genes  so they don't follow a simple dominant/recessive pattern  McDonald explained 	1	1	1
It's not straightforward to predict how blending of genes affects physical appearances  but McDonald said the tendency is for such traits to average out 	1	1	1
The average American skin and hair color will probably darken slightly  and there will be fewer people with very dark or very pale skin and hair 	1	1	1
The genetic mixing under way in the United States is also happening to a greater or lesser degree in other parts of the world  the researchers said 	1	1	1
In some places  unique physical traits tailored to the habitat still confer an evolutionary advantage and thus might not bow out so easily  in other places  immigration happens much more slowly than it does elsewhere 	1	1	1
According to Stearns  perfect homogenization of the human race will probably never occur  but in general  Earth is becoming more and more of a melting pot 	2	1	1
A population forged from the long-term mixing of Africans  Native Americans and Europeans serves as an archetype for the future of humanity  Stearns said: A few centuries from now  we're all going to look like Brazilians 	2	1	1
The Humble Business Card Gets Superpowers With NFC [EXCLUSIVE]	1	2	1
Apple may have skipped near-field communication in the iPhone 5  but that hasn't stopped everyone else from getting on board the NFC train  The latest passenger: Moo com  which just started experimenting with NFC business cards  with a planned rollout in 2013 	2	1	1
You may remember Moo as the folks who brought us Facebook business cards earlier this year  Now they're giving the whole experience of exchanging contact information a needed upgrade with short-range NFC tech 	1	2	1
It works like this: You order NFC cards from Moo  specifying what you want the NFC tag to do  It could just contain contact information  but it can also include actions like presenting a video  or an app download  or your latest tweets  When you hand someone your card  and they tap it with an NFC-enabled smartphone  the preprogrammed magic happens  (Check out an explainer video below )	1	2	1
The process isn't without its limitations  First  obviously the person will need an NFC phone  While many popular Android phones have it (and so do the coming crop of Windows Phones  if anyone cares)  Apple is out 	3	1	2
"Second  the cards will likely be a lot more expensive than conventional cards  Moo hasn't revealed pricing  but it's telling that they're only giving current customers who place a business card order a single NFC card  Moo calls it an ""open beta test "" and the NFC chip will include an electronic version of the card's contact info "	1	2	2
However  the cards come with a big bonus  too: Customers will be able to reprogram the NFC chip within to customize cards for various customers  A global manager might want to change the material presented depending on what part of the world he's in  or  if you have the cards for a while  you'll probably want to change the projects you present to new clients  Or you could just have fun with it and show a different random YouTube video on each card 	1	2	1
While the cost is still a question mark -- a big one -- we like the idea of flashing custom content to people with our cards  Of course  we stopped the silly practice of writing down phone numbers and emails years ago with the dawn of apps like CardMunch  NFC is progress  as long as the price stays under control 	2	3	2

Idaho woman charged with stick-figure threat	1	1	1
BOISE  Idaho (AP) — A woman who was about to be released from an Idaho prison will stay behind bars a while longer because federal prosecutors say she mailed a threatening stick figure drawing to a relative 	2	1	2
Linda Joyce Lakes was serving time at the Pocatello Women's Correctional Center on probation violations stemming from a 2007 grand theft sentence  and she was scheduled to be released last Friday 	1	1	2
"Prosecutors say that in 2010  Lakes mailed a drawing that apparently depicted a battered stick figure alongside threatening phrases such as ""No tears "" ''No hiding "" and ""No more you """	2	1	2
Kyle Wright  an FBI agent in Pocatello who investigated the case  described the drawing in a court document 	1	1	1
Wright also said in his affidavit that Lakes sent a letter with the drawing that indicated her prison sentence was coming to an end and that the recipient should be prepared for his final moments 	1	1	1
The FBI agent also said that Lakes told the FBI her drawing symbolized her hate for a man who had abused her in the past  and that one day she wanted to beat and possibly kill him 	2	1	3
Lakes was released from the state prison and taken into federal custody 	1	1	1
She waived her preliminary hearing on the charge and has not yet entered a plea 	1	1	1
Lisa Tolle  a paralegal with Federal Defender Services of Idaho in Pocatello  said her office had just been assigned the case and attorneys had not yet fully reviewed it 	2	1	1
Implant scandal sparks revamp of EU medical device rules	1	1	2
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has proposed tougher rules on assessing the safety and monitoring the use of medical devices and implants  after weak EU regulations were partly blamed for a global scandal over French-made breast implants 	1	1	3
Investigations last year showed that hundreds of thousands of women around the world had been implanted with substandard silicone implants made by defunct French company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP)  which safety regulators had failed to stop for more than a decade 	2	1	2
The scandal prompted calls for Europe to toughen its controls on medical devices  which are currently overseen by an ad hoc network of up to 80 national assessment agencies  most of which are private companies 	2	1	1
Just a few months ago  everybody was shocked by the scandal involving fraudulent breast implants which affected tens of thousands of women in Europe and around the world  EU health commissioner John Dalli said in a statement on Wednesday to outline the draft rules 	3	1	3
The proposals take into account lessons from the PIP implant scandal  and will significantly tighten the authorization process for medical devices before they are put on the market  the European Commission said 	2	1	2
Independent assessment agencies will be given greater powers to monitor device manufacturers  including unannounced factory inspections and regular product testing  while EU governments will be obliged to improve their supervision of the agencies 	1	2	1
Better product traceability systems will also be introduced so that people can be alerted more rapidly to safety concerns surrounding a particular device 	1	2	2
The European market for medical devices was estimated at 95 billion euros ($123 billion) in 2009  with products ranging from sticking plasters to high-tech miniature diagnostic implants and life support machines 	2	1	1
Major manufacturers of medical devices include Johnson & Johnson  Medtronic  Boston Scientific  Abbott Laboratories  Allergan and Smith & Nephew 	1	1	1
The legislation must be jointly approved by EU governments and lawmakers  which could take up to two years 	2	1	1
India's ONGC may supply crude from Azeri field to MRPL-exec	2	1	1
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp  may look at supplying its equity oil from an Azeri field to its refining unit MRPL   Chairman Sudhir Vasudeva said on Monday 	2	1	1
ONGC has acquired a minority stake from Hess in the oil producing Azeri field in Azerbaijan 	1	1	1
The move will help MRPL  an ONGC subsidiary  which has recently expanded capacity  in replacing some of the oil it used to buy from Iran  as western sanctions aimed at curbing Tehran's nuclear program disrupt shipments 	2	2	2
A company source who did not wish to be identified said ONGC's share of equity oil from the Azeri field would average 18 500 barrels per day (bpd) in 2012 	2	1	1
This source said ONGC along with IOC and Oil India has submitted a $5 billion bid for some ConocoPhillips oil sands assets in Canada 	2	1	1

Westwood is the only designer on the Paris fashion calendar — or perhaps anywhere — who can cross the globe and several centuries  mixing up Bangkok-style catwomen  Chinese tea prints  tropical cowboys  Velasquez peasants  the Ballets Russes  and still produce a coherent and unified show 	3	3	1
The epitome of femininity  Cacharel  explored spring through the natural colors of mother nature  in a trademark delicate display 	3	2	1
Sunday's shows include Kenzo  Celine and Hermes 	1	1	1
Global exotic  is how English designer Vivienne Westwood described her brilliant and wacky spring-summer 2013 show  hosted on terra mater in Paris' British Embassy 	5	3	1
Disparate encyclopedia fashion references amazingly gelled together  owing to her unique eccentricity 	5	3	1
"Westwood cited Sergei Diaghilev's ""Ballets Russes"" — the early 20th century's most famous ballet company — as a key inspiration "	1	2	1
The influential troupe used exotic styles with billowing trousers and turbans — which was evoked in many of the baggy globe-trotting looks 	3	3	1
One in light gray silk  with wide bateau collar  had fluttering hoop panels that fluttered by 	1	1	1
Above all else  Westwood — who's 71 — has lost none of her humor 	3	2	1
There was a special guest star — a model portraying Queen Elizabeth II 	3	2	1
She clutched a handbag in a crown and demure gray silk dress 	3	2	1
Viktor & Rolf were feeling reflective  looking back on almost two decades since founding their fashion house  and that was evident Saturday in their oversized spring-summer ode to 70s pleated glamor 	2	2	1
We were in a reflective mood    said Viktor Horsting  one half of the famed Dutch design duo which is approaching its 20th anniversary 	1	2	1
Not ones to normally take things quite so literally  the inseparable Viktor and Rolf channeled mirrors in their oversized spring-summer ode to 70's pleated glamor 	2	2	1
The designers  who founded their Amsterdam-based fashion house in 1993  sent models through a reflective tunnel onto a catwalk wearing mainly black  white and silver ensembles that featured blinding mirror appliques on sumptuous silks 	1	2	1
Oversized proportion — a signature mark — produced some hits 	2	2	1
Giant bows in soft pink and purple were used high or low on the waist to sumptuous effect 	3	2	1
Cacharel perfectly captured the fresh mood of spring  in a feminine collection — typical of the popular French house — that brought aquatic life to the catwalk 	4	3	1
Free hanging A-line slip dress and gently flaring peplums and skirts Saturday  floated alongside prints of goldfish skin  anemones and underwater tea flower bloom 	4	4	1
This spring-summer 2013 collection was also a celebration of the natural world in its careful palette the Cerulean blue of sky  orange of sea coral and tea green 	3	3	1
But perhaps nature is in the house DNA: After all  designer Jean Bousquet who founded the house in 1962  named it after a small  beautifully striped dabbling duck with the same name 	4	2	1
The gentle blurring made this collection a visual treat 	4	2	1
Australian Martin Grant is not a household name  but he has a solid reputation in the fashion world and a string of celebrity followers like Juliette Binoche  Kate Hudson and Cate Blanchett 	3	2	1
Saturday's clean and on-trend collection proves it's little wonder 	3	2	1
I wanted to play with volumes  Grant said backstage  referring to the many looks which had elongated peplums and jacket-skirts  twinned with black shorts — seen in Raf Simons' show for Dior 	2	2	1
Black and navy was used well in A-line with trapeze silhouettes  and accentuated midriff — one of the big parts of this season's fashion conversation — nicely nipped the silhouettes 	4	3	1
One of the colors of the season  vermilion  was used perfectly as shards of color  or completely covering dresses 	4	3	1
JAKARTA (Reuters) - One evening in late September  Peter Wesser and his club of veteran minerals explorers met at Jakarta's Hotel Kristal to swap stories and exchange news 	1	2	1
For decades explorers have enjoyed a place on the cutting edge of the country's mining boom as they scoured the earth for fresh mineral deposits  a process that can take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars before payback 	2	3	2
The government doesn't understand the importance of exploration     Mining without exploration is an industry that goes downhill 	3	1	2
Small miners in particular have been hit  leading to mine closures and lay-offs in regions such as Sulawesi island  with some resorting to bribing central government officials to continue to export  according to interviews with four mining executives 	2	1	3
An analysis of official data shows the rules have also caused a slump in exports of ore  leading key buyer China to seek supplies from elsewhere 	2	1	2
Mining already contributes 12 percent to GDP  and Indonesia is a world leader in nickel ore  thermal coal and refined tin exports  while bauxite exports have spiked in recent years 	1	2	1
If we do not begin the efforts to increase mining added value  we will be economically colonized forever  said Deputy Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Rudi Rubiandini 	3	1	3
The regulations restrict the export of raw ores  force foreign miners to divest over half their assets after 10 years of production and require domestic processing of ore by 2014 	1	1	2
SURGE THEN PLUNGE	2	2	2
The most dramatic effect of the new rules has been on mineral exports  which surged as companies fought to beat a May 6 export tax deadline and plunged thereafter 	2	2	2
In August Chinese imports of nickel ore from Indonesia dropped 39 percent to 1 48 million tonnes  following steep falls in July and June  Chinese data shows 	2	2	3
China's imports from the Philippines nearly doubled over the same period 	1	1	1
Nowhere is the human impact of the slide more visible than in the remote mining communities of Sulawesi  an island east of Borneo and the country's main source of nickel 	2	1	2
Prior to the regulations coming into force in May up to a dozen ships could be seen standing off the port of Kolaka  waiting to collect nickel ore as fleets of trucks scooped mud from nearby hills and transported it down to the docks 	2	2	1
Now the rudimentary ports stand idle and only security guards patrol the abandoned piles of mud 	2	1	2
Workers in Sulawesi said the situation for miners was worse now than in 2009 when the global financial crisis hit commodity exports worldwide 	3	1	3
The plight of Rasiun  a father-of-three  illustrates the impact on miners 	2	1	2
The former fisherman and farmer sold his land to miner Prima Nusa Sentosa  who offered him $5 a day to pull tarpaulins over ore to protect it from rain 	2	1	2
"We thought we could change our fate with the company	2	1	2
298 indonesia-digs-hole-itself-mining-laws-101410031--finance Our land is now owned by the company and run-off from the company has flowed into the sea  so now we are unemployed  he said  adding he was ""half-dead"" with worry over how he would feed his family "	2	1	4
Thousands of firms are affected by the laws and there is a backlog at the mining ministry in Jakarta as many seek the license  quota and recommendations needed to resume exports 	2	1	3
To cut red tape it helps to pay the ministry between $500 000 and $1 5 million  said a senior mining executive  who declined to be identified 	2	1	3
"Miners have to get a recommendation from the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry	2	1	2
298 indonesia-digs-hole-itself-mining-laws-101410031--finance What does the word 'recommendation' mean here?	2	1	1
298 indonesia-digs-hole-itself-mining-laws-101410031--finance You can work that out by yourself  said Juanforti Silalahi  a spokesman for miners' union Spartan "	2	1	2
The mining ministry denies there is corruption in the permit process 	2	1	3
The new regulations do not apply to miners who hold older Contracts of Work (CoW)  including some of the most prominent industry names such as the Indonesian units of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc   Newmont Mining Corp and Vale  	2	2	2
It is not clear whether the export slump  which coincides with a general downturn that has lopped about a quarter off iron ore and thermal coal prices this year and halted major mining investments in Australia  is a blip or part of a realignment that will hurt mining for a generation 	2	1	3
Insert in Print Edition of 'EW' Will Have a Live Twitter Feed	2	2	1
The magazine will sport an insert promoting the CW's fall lineup 	1	1	1
The small LCD screen will include video of the stars of the show and then a live feed from  CW_Network 	1	2	1
EW broke new ground three years ago in what was likely the first video insert in a major magazine -- a Pepsi ad that ran in 50 000 copies of the publication in New York and Los Angeles 	2	2	1
Other magazines have since followed suit  including most recently  the UK version of Marie Claire 	2	1	1
The push comes as networks are eyeing Twitter as a prime vehicle to introduce new shows and engage fans with existing ones 	2	2	1
For instance  Fox this week scored another first by premiering Raising Hope exclusively on Twitter 	2	2	1
The Mashable Media Summit 2012 will explore the impact that technology is having on media  and how digital media is affecting our lives and changing the world 	2	2	1
This one-day conference will bring together the brightest minds in media  including content creators  technology leaders  entrepreneurs  social media executives and journalists 	2	3	1

Inside the debt-limit showdown	2	1	2
PRESIDENT OBAMA SUMMONED the top four congressional leaders to the White House on Saturday morning  July 23  2011 	1	1	1
Nobody wanted to be there  Boehner later recalled 	3	1	3
They had about 10 days left before the government would run out of money 	1	1	3
Given the global importance of U S  Treasury securities  failing to extend the debt limit could trigger a worldwide economic meltdown 	2	1	4
Boehner said he believed that he and the others — Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell  Senate Majority Leader Harry M  Reid  and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi — had a plan 	3	2	1
Give us a little more time 	2	1	1
We'll come back to you 	2	1	1
We are not going to negotiate this with you 	2	1	2
I've got to sign this bill 	2	2	1
The congressional leaders want to speak privately  he said 	2	1	1
Give us some time 	2	1	1
This was it 	2	1	1
Congress was taking over 	1	1	1
Before the meeting  without telling Obama  the four leaders had tentatively agreed on the framework of a deal 	2	2	2
Around 10 p m   Obama called Boehner  who was at dinner with friends 	1	1	1
I am not going to sign a bill that requires me to deal with the debt ceiling a second time before the election  the president told him 	2	1	2
He was furious 	3	1	3
Listen  Boehner said he told Obama 	3	1	1
"I understand it    But you're not going to have a choice	3	1	2
300 inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616 We've got an agreement "	3	1	2
Obama again said he would veto such a bill 	3	1	3
We're too close to default to reopen the talks  Boehner said 	3	1	2
Congress is going to move forward on its own 	2	2	1
The president told his senior staff that the call with Boehner had led nowhere 	3	1	2
So we've got to figure out Plan B  Which is  how do we get out of this thing? he said 	3	2	2
The problem was that they did not have a Plan B 	3	1	3
IT WAS INCREASINGLY clear that no one was running Washington 	3	1	3
That was trouble for everyone  but especially for Obama 	3	1	3
Although running things is a joint venture between the president and Congress  a president has to dominate Congress — or at least be seen as dominating Congress 	3	2	2
The last president to fold was George H W  Bush  who gave in to Democrats' demands that income taxes be raised in a 1990 budget deal 	1	1	2
And Bush had been a one-term president 	1	1	2
Obama sent word that he wanted the two Democratic leaders at the White House at 6 p m  that Sunday  July 24 	1	1	1
Reid arrived in the Oval Office with his chief of staff  David Krone 	1	1	1
"Harry  the president began  ""I hear you have kind of an outline  a framework of something """	3	2	1
Reid began to lay out the two-step  $2 7 trillion debt limit extension  then stopped 	2	2	2
Well  let David just tell you what it is  he said 	3	1	1
It was highly unusual for someone to pass the ball so completely to a staffer 	2	1	2
The 44-year-old Krone outlined the plan  including a secret Republican pledge to count $1 trillion in savings from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan toward deficit reduction 	2	1	1
That was surprising 	2	2	1
Earlier  Boehner had not been willing to accept this accounting gimmick 	2	1	2
I don't trust these guys  the president said dismissively 	3	1	3
I can tell David has something else to say 	3	1	1
300 inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616 President  I am sorry — with all due respect — that we are in this situation that we're in  but we got handed this football on Friday night	3	1	3
300 inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616 And I didn't create this situation	3	2	3
300 inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616 The first thing that baffles me is  from my private-sector experience  the first rule that I've always been taught is to have a Plan B  And it is really disheartening that you  that this White House did not have a Plan B "	3	1	3
Several jaws dropped as the Hill staffer blasted the president to his face 	3	1	3
So I don't have a lot of options  in the past 36  48 hours  to put together  Krone continued 	3	1	3
"We're supposed to be the ones that fend off an economic catastrophe	3	1	4 
300 inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616 And what we find ourselves is now  with no deal  we're going to have to root for the worst possible things to happen in order to prove to the Republicans that you cannot be so callous and let the debt limit expire	3	1	4
300 inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616 That is a horrible position that we're in "" Krone said "	3	1	4
And so this may not be the perfect deal  but it's the only deal that we have on the table right now in the situation that we find ourselves 	3	1	3
"Obama replied: ""I understand what you think you're doing "	2	1	1
I'm not doing that 	2	1	1
The one thing that we need to bring stability to this economy is not throwing the debt limit increase back into the political arena 	2	1	1
I'm not doing that under any circumstances 	2	2	2
"So if that means that I'm not signing this bill  I'm not signing the bill """	2	2	2
I'm sorry  Obama said  putting an arm around Krone's shoulder 	3	2	1
"You didn't deserve that	3	3	1
300 inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616 I know how hard you're working  and I know we wouldn't even have a chance without you "	3	3	1
Reid gave Krone a ride back to the Capitol 	1	2	1
You stood up to him  Reid said 	3	2	1
He needed to hear it  and nobody was telling him 	3	2	1
"Asked later about the meeting with Reid and Krone  Obama said  ""What I said to them is  essentially  any short-term deal is not going to be acceptable "	3	2	2
We can go back to the drawing board  but we're running out of time 	3	2	2
After more pressure from Obama  Reid split from the other congressional leaders 	2	1	2
Five days later  on Friday  July 29  by a narrow margin of 218 to 210  the House passed Boehner's version of the proposal 	1	1	1
It included the two-step procedure that the president adamantly opposed 	2	2	2
IN THE WHITE House at 10 later that night  Obama's key advisers discussed the House vote in the office of William Daley  the White House chief of staff 	2	1	1
There was a chance the Senate Democrats would fold  because the fastest solution would be to pass the House bill and get out of town for their summer recess 	1	1	1
If the bill managed to gain Senate approval  would the president really veto it?	2	1	2
You can't veto  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told the group 	3	1	3
You cannot be responsible for default 	3	1	3
Anything had to be done to prevent it 	3	1	2
"If he caves  said David Plouffe  Obama's senior political adviser  ""it will have long-lasting political repercussions that we may never get out of "	3	1	3
Geithner had to deal with the possibility that the House bill could reach Obama's desk 	1	1	1
"My recommendation to the president would be  we've got to sign this	3	1	2
300 inside-debt-limit-showdown-094000616 If that's what they offer us  we sign it "	3	1	2
Obama appeared unexpectedly at the door 	1	1	1
They quickly recapped 	2	1	1
Could I actually veto it?	2	1	2
Obama asked  adopting his law professor manner 	2	2	2
What would happen on the day of the veto?	2	1	2
It would have massive effects  Geithner said 	3	1	3
That first auction could be a kind of tripwire  setting off a chain reaction 	3	1	3
Why would anyone buy U S  bonds if it's an open question whether we are going to have the authority to pay for them?	3	1	4
The cascading impact would be unknowable 	3	1	5
The world could decide to dump U S  Treasuries 	3	1	5
Prices would plummet  interest rates would skyrocket 	3	1	5
The one pillar of stability  the United States  the rock in the global economy  could collapse 	3	1	5
"So  the president said  ""if we give $1 2 trillion now in spending cuts"" — the amount in the House bill to get the first increase in the debt ceiling for about six to nine months — ""what happens next time?"""	3	2	3
The Republicans would then come back next year  in the middle of the presidential campaign  and impose more conditions on the next debt ceiling increase 	3	1	2
He could not give the Republicans that kind of weapon 	3	1	3
It was hostage taking 	3	1	4
It was blackmail 	3	1	4
So  Obama said  they had to break the Republicans on this 	3	1	2
Otherwise  they would be back whenever it suited them politically 	3	1	3
They were out of options  Geithner said 	3	1	3
The only one might be accepting the House bill  loathsome as it might be 	3	1	3
The 2008 financial crisis will be seen as a minor blip if we default  he said 	3	1	3
"The president said  ""The Republicans are forcing the risk of a default on us "	3	1	4
I can't stop them from doing that 	3	1	3
"We can have the fight now  or we can have the fight later on  but the fight is coming to us """	3	1	3
So  no  Obama said  he was not going to cave 	3	2	2
Period 	2	1	1
He was very agitated 	3	1	3
Geithner thought there was one other consideration 	3	1	1
He did not mention it to anyone  not even the president  but he had thought about it a great deal 	3	2	1
It was not just that Obama faced an economic choice or a political choice 	3	2	2
He faced a moral choice 	3	2	2
The president should not put himself in the position of saying unequivocally that he would veto  Geithner concluded  for one simple reason: No one could be sure how to put the American or the global economy back together again 	3	1	3
The impact would be calamitous 	3	1	5
Obama n ever had to confront the veto question 	3	2	2
The final plan accepted a debt limit increase that would take the country through the 2012 presidential contest 	2	2	1
The long-term deficit crisis had not been solved  but merely put off  leaving the United States at the edge of the fiscal cliff  where it remains today 	3	1	3
From The Price of Politics by Bob Woodward 	1	1	1
Insight: How Sonia Gandhi was persuaded to back India reforms	2	2	1
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - It had been a brutal August for India's Congress party: economic growth was wilting  the monsoon rains were failing and the opposition had it cornered on yet another corruption scandal 	3	1	4
It was a stunningly assertive speech from the normally temperate matriarch of a dynasty that has ruled India for most of its post-independence era 	3	3	1
And yet few at the gathering were aware that just a week earlier she had performed an even more dramatic about-face  agreeing to a raft of economic reforms that would be unveiled on September 13 and 14 	3	3	1
However  more than a dozen officials and party leaders close to the secretive inner circle of the Italian-born leader told Reuters that Gandhi was persuaded of the need for urgent action to avert a repeat of the crisis that took India to the brink of bankruptcy in 1991 	3	3	3
This time there was a very grim scenario  said Rashid Kidwai  a Sonia Gandhi biographer who was given an account of the arguments made over weeks by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his new finance minister behind the closed doors of colonial-era government bungalows in New Delhi and even on a plane journey 	3	1	3
The prime minister and the finance minister had to persuade Mrs  Gandhi that good economics was good politics 	3	2	1
"Her acquiescence in the end led to this month's ""big bang Friday"" when  a day after taking an axe to costly subsidies on diesel  the government announced that the retail market would be opened to foreign supermarket chains and the bar on foreign investment in both airlines and broadcasters would be lifted "	2	2	2
In sum  these were the most sweeping reforms since Singh took office in 2004 and - in the space of 48 hours - they dispelled the image of a prime minister who was losing his mojo as India's high-trajectory growth faltered 	3	2	2
A RELUCTANT REFORMER	2	2	2
For months  she had held out against cutting fuel subsidies that are aimed at the poor and the country's rural majority  fearing the impact on the Congress party's fortunes 	2	2	2
She only agreed when Singh and Chidambaram spelled out that new growth generated by reforms and improved investor sentiment would have a trickle-down effect and provide funds for welfare spending in time for elections due by mid-2014 	2	2	2
That means the sudden burst of reforms could be cut short if Gandhi - who Forbes magazine ranks as the world's sixth most powerful woman - sees no benefits for the rural poor on whom her party relies for votes 	3	2	3
Indeed  party sources said she will now focus on passing a bill on universal food security in December  a populist plan that would cost billions of dollars at a time when her government is under intense pressure to rein in spending 	3	2	3
She just wants enough budgetary resources available to finance her welfare schemes  said Swapan Dasgupta  a prominent journalist and commentator who leans towards the opposition 	3	2	3
"She has never spoken about reforms	3	1	3
301 insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business What she has done is make Congress think of reforms as a low priority and a political liability - she has ingrained that mindset in the party "	3	1	4
PARAMOUNT POWER	2	2	1
So determined was he to push this through  when the prime minister of the day got cold feet  he reportedly blamed the infamous inefficiency of India's telephone system to pretend that he couldn't contact the central bank in time 	3	1	3
His moves to prise open the economy set the stage for a long run of dazzling growth that peaked at 9 7 percent in 2006/07 	3	1	3
Although Gandhi appointed Singh as prime minister when the Congress party returned to power eight years ago  she has a far more socialist mindset than the Oxford-educated economist who drove that first round of reforms 	3	2	3
Sources close to the Gandhi family say she has been strongly influenced by her late mother-in-law  former prime minister Indira Gandhi  whose policies were considerably left of centre 	4	2	3
Sonia Gandhi initially declined the throne of the Congress party after the 1991 assassination of her husband and former prime minister  Rajiv  but she finally agreed to enter politics six years later to lift the flagging fortunes of the party under her family's brand name 	3	2	1
When she went abroad for surgery last year there was no official word on her illness  and the media tamely accorded her the privacy a royal might expect 	2	2	1
Ratings agency Standard & Poor's  warning earlier this year that India could become the first of the emerging market BRICS economies to lose its investment-grade rating  took a swipe at her resistance to policies mooted by Singh 	2	1	3
"The Congress party is divided on economic policies	3	1	2
301 insight-sonia-gandhi-persuaded-back-india-reforms-210251497--business There is substantial opposition within the party to any serious liberalization of the economy  S&P said "	3	1	3
A BENEVOLENT MATRIARCH	3	3	2
"Gandhi gives little away about her thinking on economic policy  but dispatches from the U S  embassy in New Delhi during the early years of Singh's tenure show she made ""repeated objections"" to proposed hikes in fuel prices  which are heavily subsidized to cushion the poor "	2	2	2
Key leaders (including Sonia Gandhi) have opposed the price hikes  criticized the way they have been handled  or urged Congress to capitulate to     demands for a 'rollback'  and the party is finding it difficult to speak with one voice  one of the cables said 	3	2	2
Describing a leader who projects herself as a benevolent matriarch  the dispatches were scathing about one of her pet projects  a scheme guaranteeing 100 days of paid employment per year for rural citizens 	2	2	2
At worst  the jobs plan is political patronage run amok and horrid economic policy  one said 	3	1	3
A batch of letters Gandhi wrote as chairperson of the council  which were recently released under the Right to Information Act  illustrate where her priorities lie 	3	2	2
"Writing to the prime minister and several ministers  she drew their attention to issues such as legal entitlement to subsidized foodgrains  child labor  housing for the poor and ""indiscriminate acquisition"" of agricultural land for private companies "	2	2	1
"In one letter  she closed by urging a minister: ""You may like to have the matter examined appropriately"" "	3	2	1
WARNINGS OF IMPENDING CRISIS	2	1	2
"How was Gandhi persuaded that  as one government official put it  ""if you are not growing you are distributing poverty""?"	2	1	2
For one thing  the economy was in trouble 	2	1	2
Growth had dropped to its lowest clip in three years  the fiscal deficit was blowing past official targets  and the government was under heavy fire for sitting on its hands as the crisis mounted 	2	1	4
There were three meetings over about four weeks     to tell her that if we don't do all this it will be bad politics  said the senior government official 	3	1	3
Singh also tackled Gandhi at length on the issue in July during a flight from Delhi to the northeastern state of Assam 	2	2	2
Adding his voice at a separate meeting  Commerce Minister Anand Sharma explained to Gandhi that opening up to global supermarkets like Wal-Mart Stores Inc could tame the corruption that plagues the state-run food distribution network - a compelling argument after two years of graft scandals that have damaged her government 	3	2	4
When Gandhi returned in September from a medical check-up abroad  the stage was set for 'big bang Friday' 	2	1	2
And although the reforms triggered the walkout of a key coalition partner from the government  reducing it to a minority  she has resisted calls for a U-turn and even plans to join a street march in favor of the retail sector reform 	2	2	2
The only thing wrong about this reforms business though is     they left it too close to the election 	3	2	3
Instagram Now Has More Daily Active Users on Mobile Than Twitter [REPORT]	1	1	1
Mark Zuckerberg must be smiling right now 	2	3	1
Instagram passed Twitter in daily active users on mobile in August for the first time  according to new comScore data provided to Mashable 	1	1	1
Instagram had 7 3 million daily mobile users for the month  while Twitter had 6 9 million 	1	1	1
In fact  comScore's data shows that Instagram's daily active user count has almost increased tenfold in the six-month period starting in March  when it had 886 000 daily active visitors 	1	1	1
Twitter's mobile user numbers have increased as well  but at a much slower rate 	1	1	1
Part of this may simply be due to the fact that Instagram is a younger company  but it's impressive nonetheless 	3	1	1
Twitter did end up having more total unique visitors in August than Instagram overall (29 million vs  21 million  respectively)  but fewer of them returned on a daily basis  and Twitter's visitors spent less time on average viewing content than visitors to Instagram 	1	1	1
Each of Instagram's mobile users spent an average of 257 minutes on the app (or more than four hours)  while Twitter's users spent an average of 169 9 minutes from mobile (or a little less than three hours )	1	1	1
The data comes from comScore's Mobile Metrix 2 0 tool  which uses survey data and on-device metering to provide a more comprehensive estimate of mobile usage for various websites and apps 	1	1	1
The data factors in visits to the apps and websites for Instagram and Twitter from iOS  Android and BlackBerry mobile devices 	1	1	1
However  it obviously doesn't take into account the number of active users who visit a website from a non-mobile device  which would certainly tilt in favor of Twitter 	3	1	1
"In an S-1 filing earlier this year  Zuckerberg explained that part of the reason he wanted Instagram was to ""enable users to increase their levels of mobile engagement and photo sharing """	2	1	1
The latest comScore numbers clearly show that Instagram has figured out mobile engagement 	1	1	1
Now the question is: When will Facebook capitalize on this by finding ways to monetize Instagram?	1	1	1

iPhone 5 poised to hit wireless carriers’ margins hard	2	1	2
While most people might not see this as a reason to panic  the wireless carriers see it differently because they’re taking a larger-than-average hit on subsidies for the iPhone and they won’t make a return on their investment until nine months after the sale  versus just six months for the typical Android device 	2	1	2
As Reuters reports  Verizon’s (VZ) profit margins are projected to fall to 43 6% in the fourth quarter this year  down from 47 4% in the third quarter  while AT&T (T) is poised to see its margins fall to 35 7% in Q4 from 40 8% in Q3 	2	1	2

Iran accuses IAEA of passing nuclear secrets to Israel	1	1	1
"Javad Jahangirzadeh  a member of parliament's presiding board  said International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano had made ""repeated trips"" to Israel  divulging sensitive information about what Tehran says is its peaceful nuclear program "	1	1	1
Records show Amano has made only one visit to Israel in his capacity as IAEA chief  in August 2010 	1	1	1
He visited Tehran in May this year 	1	1	1
If the agency's actions lead to Iran cutting cooperation with this international body  all responsibility will be with the IAEA director general  said Jahangirzadeh  also a member of parliament's national security and foreign policy committee 	3	1	1
While Hajizadeh's comments might be seen as part of the usual hawkish rhetoric from the Iranian military  the politician's accusation against the IAEA's Amano suggest Tehran's relations with the agency are severely strained 	3	1	2
Iran blames Israel and its Western allies for the assassination of nuclear scientists in Iran  including an unsuccessful attempt on Abbasi-Davani in November 2010 	2	1	3
It also blames those countries for computer viruses that appeared designed to damage its nuclear machinery 	1	1	2
The resolution prompted Iran's Parliament Speaker  Ali Larijani  to cast doubt on the benefit of Iran's membership in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)  the Tehran Times reported 	1	1	1
In another allegation of underhand behavior against Iran  the head of parliament's national security and foreign policy committee said German engineering company Siemens had planted explosives in equipment it sold to Iran for use in its nuclear program 	2	1	1
Siemens  which was building a nuclear power station in Iran before the Islamic Revolution that toppled the shah in 1979  denied Alaeddin Boroujerdi's accusation 	1	1	1
Siemens does not have any business ties with Iran's nuclear program and does not supply any technical equipment for it  a spokesman for the Munich-based multinational said 	1	1	1
Iran says it blocks Gmail based on court decision	2	1	1
TEHRAN  Iran (AP) — Iran's telecommunication minister says the government has blocked Google's Gmail service following a court order to bar access to the popular email service 	2	1	1
The semiofficial Mehr news agency quoted Reza Taghipour as saying Tuesday that Gmail had not observed Iranian law 	1	1	2
He did not elaborate but said if the court changes its decision his ministry will lift its block on Google's mail service 	1	1	1
He said Google's search engine remains available in Iran 	2	1	1
Iranian authorities have warned in recent days that they would block access to Google services  including Gmail  in response to the anti-Islam film posted on YouTube  which is owned by Google 	1	1	2
An Iranian news agency has picked up as fact a story from the paper about a supposed survey showing a majority of white Americans would rather vote for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (ah-muh-DEE'-neh-zhahd) than President Barack Obama 	1	1	1
The only trouble is it was made up  like everything in the just-for-laughs newspaper  which is headquartered in the comedic capital Chicago 	2	1	1
The English-language service of Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency republished the story Friday  several days after it appeared in The Onion 	1	1	1
"It leaves out only The Onion's description of Ahmadinejad as ""a man who has repeatedly denied the Holocaust and has had numerous political prisoners executed """	2	1	4
ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said a national dialogue leading to elections was the way towards a solution of Syria's crisis  in remarks broadcast on Wednesday 	2	2	3

Iraq bars Syria-bound plane with suspected arms	1	1	3
BEIRUT (AP) — Iraq has banned a North Korean plane from its airspace on suspicion it was carrying weapons for Syria  a government spokesman said Friday  potentially closing a supply line for President Bashar Assad's embattled regime 	1	3	3
U S  officials have accused Baghdad of allowing Iran to fly weapons to Syrian forces through Iraqi airspace  a charge Iraq has denied  North Korea and Iran are allies of Assad whose military is fighting a civil war against rebels trying to topple him 	1	1	4
"In remarks published Friday  Assad was adamant that the rebels ""will not succeed"" and said a foreign military intervention such as the one that helped topple Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi will ""not be repeated"" in Syria "	2	2	3
Assad's comments come at a time of bloody stalemate  with neither side able to deliver a knock-out blow  Activists on Friday raised the number of people killed in the 18-month conflict to nearly 30 000  Daily death tolls have been rising in recent weeks  with the regime attacking from the air and some rebels using heavy weapons 	3	1	5
Both sides have foreign backers  Assad's allies include Russia and China  along with Iran and North Korea  while the rebels are supported by the U S  and Western allies  Turkey and several Gulf states  such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia 	1	1	1
"On Wednesday  the U S  Treasury Department identified 117 Iranian aircraft it said were ferrying weapons to the Syrian regime  The department said the planes were delivering weapons and Iranian forces under the cover of ""humanitarian"" shipments "	1	1	3
Iraq has accepted Iranian assurances that it is not using Iraqi airspace to smuggle weapons into Syria  the Obama administration's choice for ambassador to Iraq  R  Stephen Beecroft  said earlier this week  He said the U S  is pressing the Iraqi government  whose Shiite-led coalition has close ties with Iran  to force flights to land and be inspected 	1	2	1
Iraq has denied it is turning a blind eye to suspected Iranian weapons shipments  but on Thursday banned a North Korean plane from using its airspace  The government rejected the request from Pyongyang to fly a plane to Syria through Iraqi skies  on suspicion it carried weapons  government spokesman Ali al-Moussawi confirmed Friday 	2	2	3
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki  an ally of Iran  has denied repeatedly that he is allowing weapons trafficking and has said Baghdad will remain neutral in the Syria conflict 	1	2	2
"The issue has been a sore point between Baghdad and Washington  It was raised again in a phone call Friday between al-Maliki and U S  Vice President Joe Biden  The vice president spoke of the need ""to prevent any state from taking advantage of Iraq's territory or air space to send weapons to Syria "" the White House said "	3	1	3
Iraq's decision to ban the North Korean plane may signal Baghdad's attempts to repair weakening relations with the United States 	1	2	3
In Damascus  meanwhile  Assad lashed out at Gulf countries  which he accused of using their enormous oil wealth to try to drive him from power  He singled out Saudi Arabia and Qatar  among his most vocal critics 	1	1	3
They think their money can buy geography  history and a regional role  Assad was quoted as saying in the Egyptian weekly Al-Ahram Al-Arabi 	3	1	3
"They are giving terrorists weapons and money with hope of repeating the Libyan model  Assad added  ""Instead of helping regional stability  they are supplying armed elements with weapons and training in order to weaken the Syrian state """	3	1	4
"Syria's ties with the Gulf nations have been strained in the past — Assad once called Saudi King Abdullah and other Arab leaders ""half men"" for being critical of Hezbollah over the 34-day war between the Lebanese Shiite militant group and Israel in 2006 "	2	1	2
After Assad's remarks were published  Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoebi told state-run TV that the president had received nine Egyptian journalists and had a chat with them about the latest developments 	1	1	1
"The minister said none of the journalists took notes as the meeting was considered a ""personal visit "" but a reporter for Al-Ahram Al-Arabi published some of what was said "	1	1	1
"In the meeting with the Egyptian journalists  Assad was also quoted as saying that the only way to solve the Syrian crisis is through ""dialogue with the opposition"" and that the ""door for dialogue is open """	1	3	1
Most Syrian opposition groups reject any talks with the regime  saying they will not accept anything less than Assad's departure from power and the dissolving of his regime's security agencies 	1	1	2
Abdul-Aziz al-Kheir and Ayas Ayyash were expected to take part in a conference Sunday in Damascus by some 20 Syrian groups that are calling for Assad to step down  But they disappeared Thursday along with a friend who had picked them up at Damascus International Airport  the group said 	1	1	3
Also Friday  the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said nearly 30 000 Syrians have been killed during the conflict 	1	1	4
The Observatory's count includes 20 935 civilians  1 153 army defectors fighting alongside the rebels  and 7 141 Syrian troops fighting for the Assad regime — which gives a total of 29 229  said the head of the group  Rami Abdul-Rahman 	1	1	2
The list is compiled from reports by witnesses and medical staff  he said  adding that he only includes those identified by name or whose death was authenticated by amateur video  The Syrian military rarely releases figures on troops killed 	1	1	3
Another Syrian opposition group  the Local Coordination Committees  put the overall death toll at 26 405  However  its count does not include Syrian troops killed in battle  The LCC relies on a network of activists in Syria to collect its information 	1	1	4
Iraq to check Syria-bound Iran flights for arms: Zebari	1	1	2
DUBAI (Reuters) - Iraq will ask Syria-bound Iranian planes passing through its airspace to land for random inspections after Washington said they could be ferrying arms to Damascus  the Iraqi foreign minister said in an interview 	3	1	3
We have informed Mrs Clinton (U S  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton) and U S  officials that the government plans to bring planes down and conduct random inspections  Zebari said in the interview published on Sunday 	3	1	3
He confirmed he was referring to Iranian planes 	2	1	2
Washington had already said it was asking Iraq about Iranian flights suspected of carrying arms to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad  a staunch Iranian ally fighting an 18-month-old revolt against his rule 	2	1	3
Iraq has said it would never allow any arms to pass through its airspace to either side in the conflict 	2	1	2
The government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki  a Shi'ite Muslim  is close to regional Shi'ite power Iran 	1	1	2
Iran is one of the main allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad  who follows an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam 	1	1	3
Zebari said the U S  officials had said any flights carrying weapons to Syrian would break U N  Security Council resolutions  and demanded Iraq stop them 	2	1	3
Washington had provided no specific intelligence of such flights  he added 	2	1	1
Iranian flights over Iraq had begun in March and stopped after Iraq asked that they be halted  the minister told the newspaper 	2	2	2
"They resumed again towards the end of July and they said these flights contain no weapons or hardware  and that they transport pilgrims  visitors and so on	2	2	2
311 iraq-check-syria-bound-iran-flights-arms-zebari-102318774 But to verify their shipments  we will ask these planes to land  he said "	2	2	2
He added Iraq had proposed holding another meeting of world powers on Syria as a follow up to the talks held in Geneva in June 	2	2	1
What we have proposed to (Russian Foreign Minister Sergei) Lavrov is perhaps there is a need to convene a 'Geneva 2' to activate mechanisms for implementing what has been agreed upon and not to reopen the discussions  he said 	3	3	1
The Geneva meeting agreed a transitional government should be set up in Syria  but the major powers were at odds over what part Assad might play in the process 	2	2	2
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Decisions taken by European Union leaders regarding Ireland's bank debt at a summit in June stand and will be implemented  the country's prime minister said after three EU finance ministers appeared to deal them a blow on Tuesday 	2	1	2

Irish regulator says Facebook adopts majority of recommendations	2	2	1
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Facebook  the world's biggest social network  has fully implemented most of the recommendations made by Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner  the watchdog responsible for regulating its European and Irish operations said on Friday 	2	2	1
Ireland is the headquarters of Facebook's non-U S 	1	2	2
The Irish regulator said most of those instructions had been adopted  particularly in the area of better transparency and controls for the user  but progress still had to be made on a number of other items within the next month 	2	3	2
Israel quiet on Ahmadinejad as Yom Kippur descends	1	1	1
The Day or Atonement runs from Tuesday afternoon through to dusk on Wednesday  meaning there was no comment either on U S  President Barack Obama's address to the United Nations 	1	1	1
"Speaking in New York  Ahmadinejad said on Monday Israel had no roots in the Middle East and would be ""eliminated"" "	1	1	3
It was the latest piece of fiery rhetoric from the Iranian leader  who has regularly riled Israel and fueled concern that if the Islamic Republic one day obtained nuclear weapons it might turn them on the Jewish State 	3	1	3
Israel's ambassador to the United Nations denounced the comments but ministers and officials in Israel were silent 	1	1	1
There was also little mention of his words in the Israeli press on Tuesday  which was focused instead on domestic politics 	1	1	1
Instead  they scrutinize the utterances of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  who  they say  is the person responsible for crucial decision-making 	1	1	2
Speaking on Monday in Jerusalem  Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor said he had no intention of getting into a slanging match with Iranian officials  adding that Israel was used to being on the receiving end of incendiary rhetoric 	1	1	2
Israel has threatened military action against Iran unless it renounces its ambitious nuclear program  which Tehran says is purely for civilian purposes but which many countries in the West believe is designed at creating an Atomic bomb 	1	1	2
Obama told the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday that time was running out to find a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue 	1	1	2
The United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon  he added 	2	1	2
However  his statement represented no advance on the previous U S  position and he appeared to ignore Netanyahu's call for Washington to establish clear red lines for Iran 	2	1	2
The Israeli leader is due to fly to New York once Yom Kippur ends and will address the General Assembly on Thursday 	1	1	1
His office has said Obama declined a request to meet the U S  president  but the two were expected to speak by telephone 	2	1	1

They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing coalition deliberations 	2	1	2

Israeli electric car company CEO steps down	1	1	1
Shai Agassi leaves behind a company that has won widespread praise and attention for his dream of ending the world's dependence on oil  but which has struggled at times to carry out that vision 	3	3	2
The circumstances surrounding his departure were not immediately clear 	1	1	1
"In a statement Tuesday  company Chairman Idan Ofer said it had achieved its goals under Agassi and had reached a ""natural point"" for change "	3	2	1
Under Shai's leadership  we've successfully achieved our goals in the first chapter of Better Place  and we owe Shai our gratitude for turning his powerful vision into a reality  Ofer said 	4	4	1
It is almost five years to the day since Shai launched Better Place and a natural point in the company's evolution to realign for its second chapter and for the challenges and opportunities ahead 	3	3	1
The chief executive of Better Place's Australian business  Even Thornley  will take over 	1	1	1
Agassi  a former top executive at German software maker SAP  will remain on Better Place's board 	1	1	1
Better Place says it aims to wean the world off fossil fuel via a network of charging stations and infrastructure to power electric cars 	2	2	1
Through a partnership with Renault  Better Place is close to completing nationwide networks in Israel and Denmark 	1	1	1
For longer trips  its infrastructure includes changing stations that allow travelers to swap their batteries in a matter of minutes  avoiding the lengthy process of recharging 	1	2	1
But the company has burned through hundreds of millions of dollars  caused in part by a slow rollout of its network and reluctance by consumers to adopt electric cars 	2	1	3
The company says that despite the heavy startup costs  it remains on solid footing and is optimistic about the future 	2	3	1
After testing the system for several months  it recently began sales of its all-electric Renault Fluence model to the general public 	1	1	1

Italy cruise ship disaster crew win seafaring award	1	2	4
"ROME (Reuters) - The crew of the Costa Concordia  the huge liner which capsized off the coast of Italy in January killing as many as 32 people  won the Lloyd's List ""Seafarer of the Year"" award for 2012  the ship's operator Costa Cruises said on Thursday "	2	2	4
The 'Seafarer of the Year' award recognises the competence  heroism and professionalism displayed by the sailors every day  Costa said in a statement 	3	3	1
Experts appointed by Italian judges to help an investigation into the accident also criticised a lack of preparation among crew members 	2	1	2
The 114 500 tonne Costa Concordia sank off the island of Giglio on January 13 after it came within metres of the shoreline and struck a rock which cut open its hull and caused it to capsize 	1	1	2
IUDs  implants urged for teen girls' birth control	1	1	2
CHICAGO (AP) — Teenage girls may prefer the pill  the patch or even wishful thinking  but their doctors should be recommending IUDs or hormonal implants — long-lasting and more effective birth control that you don't have to remember to use every time  the nation's leading gynecologists group said Thursday 	2	2	1
"The IUD and implants are safe and nearly 100 percent effective at preventing pregnancy  and should be ""first-line recommendations "" the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in updating its guidance for teens "	2	1	1
Both types of contraception are more invasive than the pill  requiring a doctor to put them in place  That  and cost  are probably why the pill is still the most popular form of contraception in the U S 	2	1	2
But birth control pills often must be taken at the very same time every day to be most potent  And forgetting to take even one can lead to pregnancy  which is why the pill is sometimes only 91 percent effective 	1	1	2
An IUD  or intrauterine device  is a small  T-shaped piece of plastic inserted in the uterus that can prevent pregnancy for up to 10 years  An implant is a matchstick-size plastic rod that releases hormones  It is placed under the skin of the upper arm and usually lasts three years 	1	1	1
"The new guidelines don't tell teens not to use other methods  but ""if your goal is to prevent a pregnancy  then using an implant or an IUD would be the best way to do this "" said Dr  Tina Raine-Bennett  head of the committee that wrote the recommendations "	2	1	1
The gynecologists group said condoms should still be used at all times because no other birth control method protects against AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases 	2	1	2
While it may sound surprising that such invasive contraceptives are being endorsed for teenagers  43 percent of girls ages 15 to 19 have had sex  a government survey found  Most are using some kind of effective birth control  but only about 5 percent use the long-lasting devices  the gynecologists group said 	2	1	2
In 21 states  all teenagers can get contraceptives without parental permission  according to the Guttmacher Institute  which tracks laws affecting women's health  A few other states allow it under certain circumstances 	1	1	2
The IUD and implant cost hundreds of dollars  The new health reform law requires health insurance plans to cover birth control without co-payments  Also  some publicly funded health clinics offer birth control free or at a reduced cost 	1	2	2
The American Academy of Pediatrics has been more cautious and has not endorsed specific methods of birth control  but is updating its guidance  Some pediatricians have been reluctant to recommend IUDs for teens  partly because of concerns over infection risks  an older model was blamed for infertility 	1	1	2
Dr  Paula Braverman  a University of Cincinnati physician involved in updating the academy's position  said the gynecologists' advice does a good job of clarifying misconceptions about IUDs and implants 	1	2	1
An IUD called the Dalkon Shield that was sold in the 1970s was linked to dangerous and sometimes deadly infections  Newer IUDs have been found to be safe  and the gynecologists group said the risk of pelvic infections increases only slightly during the first three weeks after insertion 	1	1	3
"The ones on the market today are extremely safe  said Dr  Mary Fournier  an adolescent-medicine specialist at Chicago's Ann & Robert H  Lurie Children's Hospital  who praised the new recommendations  ""That is what everybody should be telling their patients """	1	2	1
She said she already recommends IUDs for her patients and is being trained in how to insert birth control implants 	1	2	1
Raine-Bennett  research director for women's health at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland  Calif   said she gets mixed reactions from her patients about both methods 	1	1	2
Some of them say  'Great! Something that I don't have to think about ' Others are  like  'Hmmm  something in my body?' It really varies  she said 	2	2	2
Doctors need to be sensitive to that and provide detailed information to dispel any myths and allow teens to make informed decisions  Raine-Bennett said 	2	2	1
Ivory Coast to scrap grinding subsidy  lift transport support	1	1	1
The move was announced at a board meeting of the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC) late on Friday during which the body also decided to increase a key transportation-reimbursement allowance at the heart of a row threatening reform of the sector 	1	1	1
"Exporters Cargill  Barry Callebaut  CEMOI and ADM  who process a portion of their cocoa domestically  all benefit from a reduced DUS (""droit unique de sortie"") tax - the main cocoa export tax - and stand to lose if the tax break is scrapped "	2	2	2
Rival exporters say the subsidy gives the grinders an unfair advantage and cost Ivory Coast 34 billion CFA francs in 2010 	2	1	2
Farmers argue that this lost tax money should have been reinvested in the sector 	2	1	2
The president of the (CCC) informed the board of directors of the government's decision to totally repeal the fiscal advantage given to cocoa grinders  a board member told Reuters  asking not to be named 	2	1	1
This decision takes effect starting with the next harvest and should allow everyone to work together on equal footing  he said 	2	1	1
The government introduced tax incentives for local grinders during the 1991/1992 cocoa season to encourage investment in the country  create jobs in the cocoa sector  and increase grinding capacity 	1	2	1
Initially meant to last five years and apply only to exports during the April to September mid-crop  the incentives are now granted year-round and are currently worth about 75 CFA francs per kilogram of cocoa 	1	1	1
As part of a sweeping reform of the cocoa sector  the government is aiming to locally grind half of its cocoa bean production by 2015 	2	1	1
Cocoa grinders have however said the incentives do not give them any special advantage and that removing them could hurt the local grinding industry and even push some to move plants to neighbouring Ghana  the world's second-biggest producer after Ivory Coast 	1	1	1
The new cocoa season opens next month under a government-led scheme that uses the proceeds from forward-selling of the crop to guarantee prices for farmers and encourage them to reinvest in their plantations 	1	1	1
The Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC) is due within days to set a farmgate price  as well as a scale of cost reimbursement for exporters  including handling costs incurred to get the beans from farm to port 	1	1	1
The CCC has now informally suggested an increased allowance of 70 CFA francs per kg  but exporters have demanded an increase to 94 2 francs 	1	1	1
The transport and collection cost   was raised from 70 francs to 80 francs  the CCC official said 	2	1	1
The board of directors decided on this increase to avoid a blockage in October   This is the maximum we can do for them 	2	1	1
Ivory Coast sees 9 pct GDP growth in 2013	1	2	1
ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast's economy will grow by 8 6 percent in 2012 and 9 percent in 2013  government spokesman Bruno Kone said on Tuesday following a cabinet meeting 	1	2	1
The West African state's economy was previously expected to grow by 8 1 percent in 2012  its first full year since a brief civil war ground business to a temporary halt 	1	2	2
Kone said the government would propose a 2013 budget of 3 814 billion CFA francs  up 17 percent from 2012  on the back of the robust growth projections 	2	2	1
Jack Johnson Breaks His No-Social-Media Rule for Voter Registration Day	1	1	2
"Singer-songwriter Jack Johnson doesn't consider himself a tech-savvy guy -- in fact  he calls himself ""an old fart"" who doesn't tweet or even go on Facebook  but on Tuesday he will join the largest social media-driven voter registration campaign to mark the inaugural National Voter Registration Day "	2	2	2
"Johnson  along with more than 200 celebrities from Stephen Colbert to 50 Cent  will be sending tweets and posting Facebook updates to encourage people to register  Each message will also include a photo of the celebrity holding up a clipboard that says ""Register to Vote """	1	2	1
The campaign is run by voter registration organization HeadCount 	1	1	1
"HeadCount comes to our shows and volunteers walk around with clipboards to get people to sign up to vote  It's amazing to look at the numbers and see the impact it can have on registration  Jack Johnson told Mashable in a phone interview  ""I'm looking forward to seeing how it translates to the Internet """	2	2	1
HeadCount says that registering this year is crucial because many young voters who first cast a Presidential ballot in 2008 might be in for a surprise when they head to the polls this year  A recent survey found that seven out of 10 young people have moved in the past four years  according to the organization  and 43% of those potential voters haven't updated their voter registration since 	1	1	2
The campaign will also happen offline in more than 30 U S  cities at locations such as transportation centers  retail stores and concerts 	1	1	1
Johnson  who supports a number of non-profit organizations  says he is thrilled to participate in a movement that will influence a large amount of potential voters 	2	2	1
"I've always been grateful to the Internet -- without it  my music wouldn't have stood a chance  Johnson said  ""Back when I got started  people were learning to burn CDs and that was great because it allowed my album to spread even though it was in limited distribution  The web can be very powerful """	2	2	1
"Although he said he would make an exception to support the cause  he's not as active on Twitter and Facebook as his fellow music contemporaries: ""It works out great for some artists  but when I think back on my favorite artists such as Bob Marley  I can't picture him tweeting  I guess I keep it a little more romantic and mysterious that way """	2	2	1
"Johnson's Twitter account ( JackJohnson) is run by his management team  but on Tuesday  he will get more involved  When not rallying around the cause  Johnson says he is taking time now to ""really live life"" and gear up for a new album "	2	2	1
"Right now  I'm writing songs and recording sometime in the near future  he said  ""It's a little bit of an inhale  exhale thing -- I want to take enough time to read books and take in life  rather than just putting things out all at once """	2	2	2
Other musicians participating in HeadCount's social media campaign include Dave Matthews  John Legend and Reba McIntyre 	1	1	1
The deadline to register to vote in some states is as early as October 6 	1	1	1
TOKYO (AP) — Japan posted a $9 6 billion trade deficit for August as shipments to Europe and Asian countries sank  further undermining hopes for an export-driven revival in the world's third-biggest economy 	2	1	3
The 754 1 billion yen ($9 6 billion) deficit in August was not much smaller than the $9 9 billion deficit reported a year earlier  the Finance Ministry reported Thursday 	1	1	2
Exports in August totaled 5 05 trillion yen ($64 33 billion)  down 5 8 percent from a year earlier  while imports fell 5 4 percent to 5 8 trillion yen ($73 9 billion) 	1	1	2
The strong Japanese yen has bit into exports while demand has evaporated in crisis-stricken Europe 	2	1	2
Exports and industrial production are expected to remain relatively weak for the time being  the Bank of Japan said in its monthly report  released Thursday 	2	1	2
Japan has eked out small trade surpluses in some months this year but reported a record annual trade deficit for the fiscal year that ended in March 	1	2	2
Even before a recent territorial dispute flared  sparking anti-Japanese riots across China  exports were weakening 	2	1	3
The central bank's bond-buying program is meant to encourage borrowing and spending and make Japan's exports more competitive  while also exerting downward pressure on interest rates and on the yen 	1	2	1
"The central bank acknowledged that Japan's economic rebound had stalled  but predicted it would return to a ""moderate"" recovery path in the longer term "	2	2	1
Its report cited resilient domestic demand thanks to reconstruction in northeastern regions devastated by a March 2011 tsunami and earthquake and signs of quickening activity in the housing sector 	2	2	1
Central banks already have pushed short-term rates nearly as low as possible 	1	1	1
Japan Tsunami Debris Turns Up in Hawaii	1	1	3
A barnacle-covered seafood storage bin has been identified as the first piece of debris to arrive in Hawaii from the 2011 Japanese tsunami 	1	1	2
The blue cubed bin  about 4 feet (1 2 meters) on each side  was spotted floating off the coast of Waimanalo  Oahu  last week and was towed ashore by marine officials  according to a statement from Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) 	2	1	2
Officials said the plastic container belongs to Japanese seafood company Y K  Suisan  Co   Ltd   based in the Miyagi prefecture  a region hit hard by the earthquake-triggered tsunami 	2	1	3
As the disaster also set off a nuclear crisis with a partial meltdown at Japan's Fukushima power plant  health officials tested the bin for radiation but did not find any abnormal levels 	2	1	3
The bin was housing gooseneck barnacles and crabs that typically live on floating debris in the open ocean 	1	2	2
A few dead birds also were found inside the container 	1	1	2
Seventy percent of this debris is believed to have sunk offshore  but no one knows how much of the remaining 1 5 million tons are still floating in the Pacific Ocean 	2	1	3
A handful of these lost parts have already turned up on or near the west coast of North America  from a small boat that washed up on a remote island in British Columbia to a large Japanese fishing ship that officials had to sink off the coast of Alaska 	1	1	2
PARIS (Reuters) - Argos-Shimano  a team with a Japanese co-sponsor and rider  withdrew from cycling's Tour of Beijing on Wednesday amid tensions between Japan and China over disputed islands in the South China Sea 	1	1	2
Global Cycling Promotion and the local organising committee of the Tour of Beijing discussed with Team Argos-Shimano the option of not participating in the Tour of Beijing  the event's organizers said in a statement 	1	1	1
Due to the current circumstances  the team accepted to withdraw from the race 	1	1	1
The Tour of Beijing would be held as scheduled from October 9-13  the International Cycling Union (UCI) said 	1	1	1
Of course the local organising committee and Global Cycling Promotion are closely following the evolution of the situation 	2	1	1
Sino-Japanese relations deteriorated sharply this month after Japan bought the isolated East China Sea islands  called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China  from their private owner  sparking protests across China 	1	1	2
FLORHAM PARK  N J  (AP) — Darrelle Revis is back in action for the New York Jets 	1	2	1
And  as far as Revis is concerned  there's no doubt whether he'll be on the field against the Dolphins in Miami 	2	3	1
I'm playing  Revis said after practice 	2	3	1
The doctors cleared me  so I'll be playing Sunday 	2	3	1
"He has no more restrictions  and just to show how ready he is  Revis jokingly added: ""I can bang my head on a wall if I want to """	2	2	2
If it's not the final hurdle  I don't want to be saying something that isn't true  Ryan said 	3	3	1
Hopefully he'll play  but I guess we'll see 	3	3	1
Revis practiced fully Thursday after passing all required tests 	1	2	1
He needed to be cleared by the team physician and an independent neurologist to participate in contact drills 	1	2	1
Revis was injured Sept  9 against Buffalo when he was accidentally kicked in the head by teammate Bart Scott while attempting a tackle 	1	1	2
The cornerback said he didn't need to be re-evaluated after practice anymore since he was cleared medically  so barring a setback  Revis will be back in the Jets' secondary on Sunday 	2	2	1
I think you feel good when you have the best player on the field  Ryan said 	3	3	1
"That can't hurt you	3	2	1
326 jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl     There's only one Darrelle Revis	1	1	1
326 jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl I know I feel great about it	3	3	1 
326 jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl It's hard not to smile if he's out there	3	3	1
326 jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl You feel great as a playcaller "	3	3	1
And it comes at a good time for the Jets (1-1)  who take on the AFC East-rival Dolphins (1-1) in a game with some early importance 	3	3	1
This is a must-win for us  Revis said 	3	3	1
"We need this win	3	3	1
326 jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl The expectations are high for us to go down there and get a win Sunday "	3	3	1
Revis didn't travel with the Steelers for the game in Pittsburgh after not being cleared for contact late last week 	1	1	1
"He said he felt as though he were in ""a fog"" right after he was injured  but progressively felt better "	2	2	2
"I actually got a couple jams in on press (coverage) and got physical with some guys	3	2	1
326 jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl Contact actually felt good today  hitting guys and guys were hitting me back "	3	3	1
Revis added that he felt pretty good Wednesday  too  and told the trainers that he didn't want to wear the red non-contact jersey in practice 	3	3	1
His presence will be a big boost to the Jets' defense  which received solid play from Kyle Wilson in his place  but Revis is considered by many to be the best player in the league at his position 	3	4	1
I'm definitely happy that he's cleared for contact  Ryan said 	3	3	1
"Without question  I'm happy about that  for his sake	3	3	1
326 jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl He loves to play  but if he's healthy  I think that's the big thing	3	4	1
326 jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl As a coach  having probably  if he's not the premier defensive player in the league  he's certainly up there  so having him as a player  obviously  you're happy for that also "	3	3	1
Without Revis on the field  the Jets allowed Ben Roethlisberger to throw for 275 yards and two touchdowns 	1	1	2
He also had a passer rating of 125 1 	1	1	2
I'm just one guy  Revis said 	3	2	1
The challenge this week for the Jets will be defending do-it-all running back Reggie Bush  but having Revis in the lineup will help them try to shut down the Dolphins' receivers and force rookie Ryan Tannehill into making mistakes 	3	3	2
Having a special player like Darrelle  we ask him to do a lot of different things  Ryan said 	3	2	1
"A lot of times  we put him one-on-one with a guy  on a team's best receiver and roll coverage away from him	3	2	1
326 jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl He's just that kind of guy "	3	2	1
Tight end Dustin Keller (right hamstring) and safety Eric Smith (hip/knee) were upgraded Thursday to limited after not practicing Wednesday 	2	2	1
Keller injured his right hamstring in the Jets' second preseason game against Carolina  and then tweaked it again during practice last Wednesday 	1	1	2
We'll see how he goes through practice today  but it's much better than yesterday when he was out  Ryan said 	3	3	1
Hopefully  that is a sign that he'll play this week 	3	2	1
The team gives him one day off from practice each week to reduce wear and tear on his heel  which caused him to miss the end of last season with the Washington Redskins 	2	2	2
NOTES: Landry was called for a personal foul for a late hit last week and another for a horse-collar tackle  but Ryan enjoys the safety's aggressive style 	2	2	2
I love the fact he has a reputation as a huge hitter because he's clean  the coach said 	3	3	1
"There isn't anybody saying he's not a clean player	3	3	1
326 jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl He's a clean player	3	3	1
326 jets-revis-cleared-says-im-playing-miami-223701532--nfl He's a hitter "	3	3	1
Landry won't slow down or change the way he plays  either 	2	1	1
When I'm in the game  I'm not thinking about a penalty I'm about to have or anything like that  he said 	3	2	2
I'm just playing a play to win and do anything to help my team out 	3	3	1
    ST coordinator Mike Westhoff has said this will be his 30th and final year coaching in the NFL  and he hasn't reconsidered at any point so far 	2	2	1
I don't close doors  but I think I just made a decision that this would be enough and the time to maybe look at something else  Westhoff said 	3	2	1
"CONCORD  N H  - While railing against Mitt Romney's comment about the 47 percent of voters who consider themselves to be ""victims "" Vice President Joe Biden misstated the number of U S  troops remaining in Afghanistan by several hundred thousand Friday evening "	3	1	2
"By the way  those dependent people he refers to  those 47 percent  they include the 650 000 troops still left in Afghanistan who  because they are in combat  being shot at  injured  they do not have to pay any federal income tax on their salary	3	1	3
327 joe-biden-misstates-troop-size-afghanistan-021017152--abc-news-politics I don't call that dependency	4	1	1
327 joe-biden-misstates-troop-size-afghanistan-021017152--abc-news-politics I call that ingratitude to not recognize they are a part of that 47 percent  Biden said on the steps of the state house in Concord  N H "	3	1	2
Following the event  a Biden aide clarified Biden intended to say there are approximately 68 000 troops left in Afghanistan 	3	1	1
President Obama announced the temporary surge of troops in Afghanistan  which would include the deployment of 33 000 troops  two years ago 	1	1	1
Jones  Wainwright highlight 'Artists Den'	1	1	1
"NEW YORK (AP) — Singer Norah Jones performs in a former Brooklyn brass foundry near her home in the opening of a new season of PBS' ""Live From the Artists Den"" in two weeks "	1	1	1
The four-episode season will also feature Rufus Wainwright  the Wallflowers and Mayer Hawthorne 	1	1	1

Despite the short season  PBS says producers are already at work preparing another season for next year 	1	2	2
(AP) — A federal judge has lifted a ban on sales of Samsung Electronics Corp 's Galaxy 10 1 tablet computer 	1	2	1
U S  District Judge Lucy Koh ruled Monday the South Korean technology giant is now free to start selling the product in American stores 	1	2	1
The judge had previously banned U S  sales of the tablet pending the resolution of a sweeping patent trial between Apple Inc  and Samsung over vital technology used in smartphones and tablet computers 	2	1	2
But the jury found that Samsung's Galaxy 10 1 wasn't one of the offending products 	1	2	1
The judge scheduled a December hearing to consider Samsung's demand for a new trial 	1	1	1
NEW YORK (AP) — Viewers of Katie Couric's talk show were doubtless surprised on Monday when  during the discussion of eating disorders  Couric disclosed that she had had her own struggles with that cruel  sometimes deadly condition 	3	1	3
"But the bulk of the show was devoted to her guests  who included experts on the subject as well as its sufferers  notably singer and new ""X Factor"" judge Demi Lovato "	1	1	2
During the hour  Couric said little more about her experience  which she had never before made public 	1	1	1
"I kind of hesitated to even bring it up  she told The Associated Press after the taping  ""But I felt that if I expect people on my show to be honest  then  when relevant  I owe it to people watching to be honest myself "	1	2	1
"I wanted to focus on my guests  she said  ""while acknowledging one of the reasons this issue is so important to me: I went through it """	1	1	1
But in an exclusive interview with the AP  Couric  55  shared details about the illness that first plagued her as a senior at Yorktown High School in Arlington  Va 	2	1	3
It began  she said  when she learned she had been turned down by the college she most wanted to attend 	1	1	2
Couric was a likely candidate for an eating disorder 	1	1	2
"Like a lot of young women  I was struggling with my body image  she said  ""and feeling like I wasn't good enough or attractive enough or thin enough """	2	1	3
"She termed her figure at the time as ""curvy "" and not the cultural ideal  which she identified as ""five-foot-eight and weighing 115 pounds  It can be so difficult to embrace the body that you have if it doesn't fit with the ideal  Women get praised for being super-thin  so you keep striving to be that way """	3	1	3
"She said her disorder ""ebbed and flowed"" through the years "	3	1	3
"Some periods were worse than others  when I was binging and purging a lot  she said  ""I'd have a piece of gum that wasn't sugarless and then say  'Oh! I've been bad ' and then feel so terrible that I would eat and throw up  It was awful "	1	1	3
Couric attended the University of Virginia  then landed her first job at the ABC News bureau in Washington  D C  And even then  she was waging a battle with food 	1	1	3
"But since then  she said  ""I've learned how to have a much healthier relationship with food  and how to enjoy my life without obsessing about food """	1	3	1
"And it's not the first time Couric has let the public in on a personal ordeal  Her audience shared her pain from the death of her husband  Jay Monahan  of colon cancer in 1998  The tragedy led Couric  then a co-anchor of ""Today "" to become an advocate for colon cancer awareness and for colonoscopies  In 2000  she underwent a colonoscopy on the air "	2	2	4
"The educational aspect far outweighed any personal embarrassment I might have felt  she explained  ""I had just lost my husband at 42 to this No  2 cancer killer of men and women  I had a bully pulpit from which I could implore people to take steps that could potentially save their lives  It was a no-brainer """	3	2	4
"In the future  viewers of ""Katie"" can expect her to confide in them again when it feels right "	1	2	1
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya's year-on-year inflation fell for the tenth straight month to 5 32 percent in September from 6 09 percent in the previous month  the statistics office said on Friday 	1	1	1
Kenya navy shells Somali town after rebels announce retreat	1	1	3
MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Kenyan warships shelled the southern Somali port of Kismayu overnight after al Qaeda-linked rebels said they had abandoned the city  residents said on Sunday 	1	1	3
Stunned by an assault by sea  air and ground forces late on Friday night  al Shabaab rebels fled the city that had been their key source of revenue  retreating to surrounding forests and towns 	3	1	3
The shells may have been targeting any remaining pockets of resistance or military installations in the city that was the rebels' last stronghold 	1	1	3
The troops are consolidating and making plans to expand into the southern part of the city  Oguna told Reuters 	1	2	1
A lot of caution must be exercised here  We don't want to get into a situation where we start to lose troops here and there 	1	1	2
The southern part is the city center and whoever wins it will effectively have control over the port and other strategic installations 	2	2	1
The Kenya Defence Force and the Somalia National Army  fighting under the flag of the African Union force in Somalia (AMISOM)  have not suffered any casualties in the operation  Oguna said 	1	3	1
An al Shabaab official said that although the group had ceded control of Kismayu  its fighters were poised to engage the allied troops once they enter the city 	1	1	3
We are just waiting for the AU and Somali troops to enter the town  We shall fight them in streets and alleys  We abandoned the town  Why don't they go in if they have the guts? Sheikh Hudayfa Abdirahman  the group's head of Jubba region  told Reuters 	1	1	3
In Kenya's capital Nairobi  a nine-year-old boy was killed and three children wounded by a hand grenade thrown into a Sunday school session in a church on Sunday  an act police said was the work of al Shabaab sympathizers 	2	1	5
The rebel group  which counts foreign al Qaeda-trained fighters among its ranks  is seen as one of the biggest threats to stability in the Horn of Africa  It has received advice from al Qaeda's leadership  counter-terrorism experts say 	3	1	3
The insurgents  who once controlled swathes of the lawless Horn of Africa country  have turned to guerrilla tactics  harrying the weak government of newly-elected President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud with suicide bombings and assassinations 	3	1	5
Abdirahman said the onset of rains would help al Shabaab fight back 	1	2	1
We shall fight the enemies in the muddy jungles between Kismayu and Kenya  Enemies will be stuck in the mud  We are sure the enemies will never rule peacefully  he said 	3	3	1
Kismayu residents said the chaos was causing hardships 	1	1	3
Food prices and dollar value have risen a bit this morning  If the situation remains this way for days  we anticipate inflation and then starvation  said shopkeeper Abdullahi Nur 	1	1	3
Some civilians fled the city in minibuses on rough roads that twist through the surrounding jungles 	1	1	2
I will also evacuate my children if Kismayu does not change positively  said Ismail  the mother of four 	1	1	2
NAIROBI (Reuters) - The Kenyan shilling was steady against the dollar but could come under pressure if figures due Friday show inflation is still falling  which could drag down investor returns from government bonds 	2	2	2
We are watching out to see where inflation will come in  said Dickson Magecha  a trader at Standard Chartered Bank 	1	1	1
At 0832 GMT  commercial banks quoted the shilling at 85 20/40 versus the dollar  barely changed from Thursday's close of 85 25/45 	1	1	1
Inflation in the east African nation soared last year to peak at nearly 20 percent in November  due to a widening fuel import bill and drought  which dragged the shilling through a series of record lows 	2	1	3
A tight monetary policy adopted by policymakers in the fourth quarter of 2011 helped bring down inflation for nine straight months and stabilised the foreign exchange rate 	1	2	1
A Reuters poll of 11 analysts showed that year-on-year inflation could fall to 5 40 percent in September from 6 09 percent in August 	2	2	1
Traders said the shilling could come under pressure from last minute end-month importers demand for the dollar and banks piling on greenbacks in anticipation that lower inflation in September could give room for a further cut in rates by the central bank 	3	1	2
"We expect to see a bit of weakening due to energy flows	3	1	2
333 kenyan-shilling-steady-vs-dollar-eyes-inflation-094749348--business We could touch 85 50 by the close of the day  Magecha said "	2	1	1
What You Know Already: Being Overweight is Bad For You  What You Need to Know: It Can Also Give You Cancer	2	1	2
It’s no secret that there’s an obesity epidemic in America 	2	1	2
But the side effects from being overweight  including cancer risks  continue to multiple 	1	1	2
Early treatment of prostate cancer  one of the most common cancers in men  is usually very successful 	1	2	1
But ScienceDaily reports today that  ”obesity increases the risk of aggressive prostate disease 	1	1	2
New research  published in BioMed Central's open access journal BMC Medicine  finds that the fat surrounding the prostate of overweight or obese men with prostate cancer provides a favorable environment to promote cancer growth ”	1	1	2
While they note that fat “is a major player in the immune system  which protects the body from infection and disease ” the bad news is that “too much fat can cause these systems to go haywire and can increase the risk of diabetes  cardiovascular disease and cancer ”	1	1	2
And this new research shows that  “Regardless of type of prostate disease the overweight men had different levels of gene activity in the fat surrounding their prostates compared to the lean men ”	1	1	2
To put things in perspective  the National Cancer Institute (NCI) says that in “One study  using NCI Surveillance  Epidemiology  and End Results (SEER) data  estimated that in 2007 in the United States  about 34 000 new cases of cancer in men (4 percent) and 50 500 in women (7 percent) were due to obesity 	1	1	2
The percentage of cases attributed to obesity varied widely for different cancer types but was as high as 40 percent for some cancers  particularly endometrial cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma ”	1	1	1
Earlier this year  the journal Science observed that  “Insulin and a related hormone known as insulin-like growth factor (IGF) are now at the center of a growing wave of research around the world aimed at elucidating what many scientists consider to be their critical role in fueling a wide range of cancers 	1	1	1
Elevated levels of insulin and IGF are also the leading candidates to explain a significant correlation in epidemiology that has gained attention over the past 30 years: Obese and diabetic individuals have a far higher risk than lean healthy people of getting cancer  and when they do get it  their risk of dying from it is greater ”	1	1	3
Furthermore  in March  USA Today reported  “Although the overall rate of new cancer cases is declining      	1	2	1
"About one-third of adults—almost 78 million—are obese  roughly 30 or more pounds over a healthy weight """	1	1	2
"They go on to quote physician Marcus Plescia  director of the division of cancer prevention for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  who said  ""I don't think Americans understand the association between cancer and obesity      "	2	1	2
We do know people are afraid of cancer 	2	1	2
They know about the links (from obesity) to diabetes  heart disease and arthritis  but many don't know about this 	2	1	2
"They need to know """	2	1	1
Consider yourself warned 	3	1	1
Are these findings likely to make you more aware of the dangers of being overweight and cause changes in your behavior if you find you’re putting on the pounds?	2	1	2
Knowing Neil Armstrong: One Giant Leap for an Apollo Fanatic	2	2	1
As the nation bid farewell to Neil Armstrong earlier this month  my wife and I sat in the stone-and-stained-glass grandeur of the National Cathedral listening to appreciations of history’s first moonwalker 	3	2	2
For me it was the end of a journey that had begun more than four decades earlier  even before Armstrong took his “one small step” onto the Sea of Tranquillity  during the summer I turned 13 	3	3	1
Watching him on TV at the Apollo 11 pre-flight press conference in 1969 I sensed something special about him  a thoughtful  articulate nature that seemed to set him apart even from other astronauts 	4	4	1
He quickly became for me a hero among heroes  a kind of superman 	5	5	1
And yet  I heard him say before and after Apollo 11 that he was not unique  not deserving of special praise  a message I managed to absorb even as I idolized him 	3	4	1
I’d already been lucky enough to meet several Apollo astronauts  but now  as a full-fledged Apollo fanatic  meeting Neil Armstrong became one of my fondest hopes—not quite an obsession  but close 	4	5	1
Two years later  in September 1971  on a sightseeing trip to Washington D C   with my parents  I dragged them to NASA Headquarters 	3	2	1
There I learned that Armstrong  no longer an active astronaut  actually had his office in that building 	2	2	1
In that moment  the rest of the world fell away  and I had a mission 	3	2	2
I took a taxi by myself back to NASA 	1	1	1
Making my way down the long corridor to Armstrong’s office  barely containing my excitement  I reached my goal only to be told by his secretary that he wouldn’t be in that day 	3	4	2
Dejected  I headed back toward the elevators 	3	1	3
But then  as I looked up  my gloom vanished: there was Armstrong  carrying his briefcase  walking toward me 	4	4	1
"I told him  ""I'm about as interested in space as you can get """	5	4	1
I had brought along my dad’s little Minox camera  but there was no one else in the hallway where we stood 	2	2	2
Armstrong offered to take the picture himself  holding the Minox with one outstretched hand and pointing it back at us 	1	2	1
And then  before we parted  I tried to communicate to him that I understood he was not a superman but a flesh-and-blood human being 	3	3	1
Armstrong didn’t say anything in response 	1	1	1
Looking back  I'm pretty sure he didn't know what to make of this 15-year-old who looked much younger  with a mop of hair  saying such things 	3	3	1
I had met my ultimate hero 	5	5	1
By now I knew only too well his reputation for reticence and his reluctance to grant interviews  but I had managed to win his cooperation 	3	2	1
Still  I wasn’t sure what to expect from this encounter 	1	1	1
"Armstrong had warned me on the phone a couple of weeks earlier not to expect him to answer personal questions  he would only talk about ""matters of fact """	2	2	1
And yet  as the interview progressed  we connected 	1	1	1
He answered my questions about Apollo 11 with intelligence and humor 	2	3	1
When I asked about the experience of taking the first human footsteps on the moon  he surprised me by saying that for him  “The emotional moment was the landing 	3	3	1
That was human contact with the moon… And the business of getting down the ladder  to me  was much less significant 	3	3	1
And when I asked about the enormous role in which fate had placed him as the first human being to walk on another world  his answer revealed a man who saw himself in the broad sweep of human achievement 	3	3	1
"What mattered to him  he said  were the contributions he’d helped make to Apollo and the other programs he’d worked on  things that helped get humanity ""to a new plateau to look from "	3	3	1
"That’s just the way I tend to look at things """	3	2	1
Interviewing Neil Armstrong was one of the highpoints of my professional career 	2	3	1
I valued his feedback on my work 	3	3	1
Neil Armstrong went to the moon with the supreme self-confidence and skill necessary to carry out history’s ultimate test flight 	3	5	1
When he returned  despite his innate shyness  he showed the strength of character to carry out the mission we gave him  one for which there could have been no adequate preparation: to be a world icon 	3	5	1

Are Kristen Stewart & Robert Pattinson Living Together?	1	1	1
Have Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson moved back in together or are they just simply talking?	2	1	1
According to Us Weekly  the pair is reportedly back together under the same roof once again after moving out of the house they shared following Kristen's cheating admission 	1	1	2
They are living together and have reconciled  a source told the mag 	1	2	1

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Minnesota Orchestra was called the world's greatest not long ago  welcome recognition for musicians outside a top cultural center 	3	4	1
In Minneapolis  the Minnesota Orchestra has already cancelled concerts through Nov  25 as negotiators argue over a proposal to trim the average musicians' salary by $46 000 a year 	2	1	2
A similar standoff is underway across the Mississippi River at the St  Paul Chamber Orchestra 	1	1	1
The Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra has canceled the first month of its season in a labor impasse  and labor troubles are also rumbling at orchestras in Richmond  Va   Jacksonville  Fla   and San Antonio  Texas 	2	1	2
It breaks my heart  said Christal Steele  a violinist and assistant concertmaster in Indianapolis  where she and fellow musicians have gone without pay and benefits for almost a month 	3	1	3
"This is my 40th season  and in that time  I have seen nothing but this orchestra rise in quality and in stature	3	3	1
338 labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859 Now in one fell swoop  they're trying to erase the last 30 years "	3	1	3
Last week  musicians and management at the symphony orchestras in both Chicago and Atlanta reached new contracts after contentious negotiations 	1	2	2
Atlanta's musicians went without pay for a month before accepting $5 2 million in compensation cuts over two years  plus reductions in their ranks 	1	1	3
The Chicago deal came after a two-day strike that forced the cancellations of the season's first Saturday night show  with musicians wrangling salary increases but agreeing to pay higher health care costs 	1	2	2
It's shaking up a lot of organizations right now  said Drew McManus  a Chicago-based consultant to orchestras and other arts organizations 	3	1	2
This world of orchestras is one that's always been defined by well-established strata — the best orchestras in the country  the second tier and so on — and that is very much in flux at the moment 	3	2	1
The Finnish-born Vanska has become something of a celebrity in a state that treasures its Scandinavian heritage  and he's won international acclaim for pushing the orchestra to new heights 	3	4	1
"After seeing the Minnesota Orchestra play at Carnegie Hall in 2010  The New Yorker's classical music critic Alex Ross wrote that they ""sounded  to my ears  like the greatest orchestra in the world """	4	5	1
But the orchestra's leaders have said even as its reputation grows they've seen flat attendance  declining corporate and individual support  and poor results from investments 	3	2	3
You couple that with one of the worst financial markets of the last 100 years  and obviously you have to reset our orchestra and our organization in terms of looking to a future that's sustainable  said Michael Henson  the orchestra's president 	4	2	4
He said the orchestra has been forced to draw too deeply from its endowment to stay in the black 	2	2	2
A very significant part of our expenses are musicians' salaries  and that's a logical area for us to address to find a solution for long-term stability  Henson said 	3	2	2
Management's proposal would trim average annual salaries for orchestra members from $135 000 to $89 000 	2	1	2
Doug Wright  the Minnesota Orchestra's principal trombonist and a member of the musicians' negotiating team  said the wages reflect the skill involved in reaching the top level and big salary cuts would result in a loss of talent 	3	2	3
The musicians of a major American symphony orchestra live in a global marketplace  Wright said 	3	2	2
"And if we're going to continue to attract and retain the best of the best  our competition is not  you know  the local marching band	3	2	1
338 labor-standoffs-silence-orchestras-minn-indy-201425859 Our competition is Boston  Chicago  L A   San Francisco "	3	1	1
Musicians have demanded an open audit of the orchestras' finances  complaining about a $50 million renovation of Orchestra Hall's lobby now underway 	3	1	3
Henson said renovation funds come from dedicated donations and are needed to keep drawing audiences and big donors 	2	1	1
These are big cultural trends that are affecting the movie business  and professional sports  and the way our culture operates now  he said 	3	1	2
So it's not surprising that we're likely to see a period of visible experimentation in American orchestras and the way they operate 	3	1	2
Langer's recipe for Cup success on U S  soil	3	2	1
MEDINAH  Illinois (Reuters) - 'Home cooking' has helped the United States win the Ryder Cup all but three times on American soil but former captain Bernhard Langer has already proved once that he has the recipe for European success 	3	2	1
Eight years ago  Langer led Europe to a record victory by 18-1/2 points to 9-1/2 at Oakland Hills and the meticulous German believes his continent can triumph again this week by using a similarly subtle mix of various ingredients 	3	2	1
Though Langer believes home advantage will give the U S  a slight edge over holders Europe at Medinah Country Club  he expects the winning margin to be wafer thin  whichever team prevails 	2	1	1
There are lots of little things a captain can do that could have an influence positively or negatively on a Ryder Cup  the twice Masters champion told Reuters on Wednesday a short distance from 18th green on Medinah's No  3 Course 	1	1	1
"Asked what advice he would give to European captain Jose Maria Olazabal for this week's showdown  Langer replied: ""To communicate well to his players  to keep them happy  especially those guys who are not playing "	2	2	1
"He has to figure out his best players on the course and if he puts someone out and if he is not confident enough or not playing well  he needs to give him a rest  give him a chance to work out his game or his putting stroke or whatever it is and hope he will be ready for the singles 	2	1	1
339 langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf If he has someone who is hot  let him play "	2	2	1
Get out there and make more points 	3	2	1
"Find out who is comfortable with this golf course and with the speed of the greens and figure out who might not be comfortable """	1	1	1
The fact that four players have to sit out each of the foursomes and fourballs sessions on the Friday and Saturday gives the captain a public relations headache  according to Langer 	2	1	2
"I was never happy sitting out and I am sure no one is ever happy 	3	1	2
339 langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf They are all thinking  'Why me?"	3	1	1
So you've got to make sure that you explain to them what you're thinking is and that everybody is going to play before Sunday which I think is vital 	2	1	1
The teams are very evenly matched  although the Americans are the favourites playing at home  the 55-year-old said 	2	1	1
"The golf course is set up a little different than most golf courses with no rough which is unheard of nowadays	1	1	1
339 langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf I guess captain Davis Love must have put some thought into that because he can set up the golf course any which way he feels benefits his players so we will see how that will play out "	2	1	1
I know the Americans have some big bombers in there but we have a couple ourselves that hit it pretty far so I don't see a real advantage on either side 	2	2	1
Langer  an official patron of the Ryder Cup who is a global ambassador for Mercedes-Benz  said home advantage at a Ryder Cup related to the crowd atmosphere and not to the course 	2	1	1
"The crowd is either for you or against you and that plays with your emotions  it plays with the whole atmosphere 	2	1	1
339 langers-recipe-cup-success-u-soil-000734237--golf It is  in a sense  very hostile to the visiting nation and advantageous for the home team "	2	2	2
It's unique when you're out there 	3	2	1

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Large parts of Aleppo's covered market  the largest of its kind in the world and a UNESCO world heritage site that traces its history back to the 14th century  have been reduced to ashes as government forces and rebels fight for control of the city 	1	1	2
The historic market was largely undamaged by earlier fighting in Syria's largest city  but in the early hours of Saturday some of its shops caught fire during clashes in circumstances that remain unclear 	1	1	2
The flames spread rapidly  partly because many of the small retail units tucked beneath the market's ancient arches were full of fabric  and have now ravaged at least 1 500 shops and are still burning  activists said 	1	1	2
It is not only the souk that is burning  my heart is burning as well  said an anti-government activist called Hashem who learnt the craft of jewelry-making in the souk before the revolt against President Bashar al-Assad erupted last year 	2	1	2
Aleppo's old city is one of several places that UNESCO  the United Nations cultural agency  has designated world heritage sites and which are now at risk 	1	1	2
UNESCO believes that five of Syria's six world heritage sites have already been damaged  Other heritage sites include the ancient desert city of Palmyra  the Crac des Chevaliers crusader fortress and parts of old Damascus 	2	1	2
The fire is still raging and at least 1 500 shops have now been burnt down 	1	1	2
The market - Souk al-Madina - comprises a network of vaulted stone alleyways and carved wooden facades and was once a major tourist attraction and a busy cosmopolitan trading hub on the ancient Silk Road from China 	1	2	1
Its many narrow alleys have a combined length of 13 km (8 miles) making it the largest covered market in the world and it sells everything from soap to jewelry to clothing 	1	2	1
Activists said they were working to try to document the scale of the damage  which it is estimated it will cost millions of dollars to repair 	1	1	2
The fire spread as far as the Umayyad Mosque  the fighters who managed to stop it from spreading even further  an activist from the city called Yasser said 	1	2	2
For all those asking why the fighters are in the Old City  we say we have only entered to liberate it	1	2	2
Rebels said they were involved in heavy clashes in Aleppo on Sunday  saying they had attacked the Neirab military air base  They also reported fighting in Arkoub  east of the city 	1	1	2
The failure of either side to break the military deadlock is reflected diplomatically  with foreign powers divided over how to act  Western states and Gulf Arab countries back the opposition but most seem reluctant to interfere  while Russia  China and Iran back Assad 	1	1	2
Speaking to a conference of the ruling AK party in Turkey  Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi - who has said he opposes military intervention in Syria - said he favored a diplomatic solution facilitated by the Arab League  the United Nations and individual countries across the world 	1	2	2
"He said the Syrian people were being ""butchered and killed day and night"" and that he fully backed their struggle to overthrow Assad "	1	1	2
We will not be calm  we will not settle down until this bloodshed stops and until the will of the Syrian people to choose their own leader is realized and until this current oppressive leadership disappears  he said 	2	1	3
This oppressive regime is spilling the people's blood and the Syrian people must gain full liberty 	1	1	2
Activists reported fresh clashes in Damascus suburbs on Sunday and at least eight bodies were reported to have been found in the northern suburb of Barzeh  Clashes were also reported to have erupted in some parts of Homs city 	1	1	3
A last hurrah at the 50th New York Film Festival	1	1	1
NEW YORK (AP) — When the playwright Tony Kushner recently grabbed a microphone and sat down for a post-screening Q&A with a filmmaker and the film's cast  he mumbled that he felt like Richard Pena 	2	1	1
So central has Pena been to film in New York over the last 25 years that for many merely sitting in front of a movie screen here is likely to bring him to mind  As the programming director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center and chairman of the New York Film Festival selection committee  he's one of the city's most devoted advocates of global cinema 	2	2	1
This year's New York Film Festival  the 50th  is also Pena's last  After 25 years  Pena is retiring at the end of the year 	1	1	1
"I'd be really pleased to be known as the person who kept the — what I think — extremely high level of the festival constant  Pena said in a recent interview in Lincoln Center's Walter Reade Theater  ""That indeed I was given a trust in 1988 and I didn't screw up """	3	2	1
Most would give him far more credit than that  Pena has overseen film at Lincoln Center through a tumultuous period that's seen the graying of art house audiences  the birth of digital filmmaking and distribution  the exponential growth of film festivals and the shift of the art film's epicenter away from Europe and toward the Middle East  Asia and South America 	2	2	2
"It hasn't always been easy — critics have claimed narrowing relevancy for the NYFF — but most see in ""The Festival"" an exalted  uncorrupted platform of some of the best in movies  When the 50th NYFF begins Friday  it will be much how it's always been: a carefully curated  highly-selective few dozen films from around the world  including choice offerings from international festivals and highly anticipated fall films from Hollywood "	3	3	2
"The premiere of Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi "" a 3-D adaptation of the fantastical bestseller  opens the festival  ""Sopranos"" creator David Chase's directorial debut  ""Not Fade Away "" is the midway centerpiece  And the Robert Zemeckis drama ""Flight "" starring Denzel Washington  will close the fest "	1	1	1
"The rest of the 32 movies in the main slate include films from Noah Baumbach (""Frances Ha"")  Brian De Palma (""Passion"")  Olivier Assayas (""Something in the Air"")  Michael Haneke (""Amour "" the Palme d'Or winner at Cannes)  Cristian Mungiu (""Beyond the Hills"") and Abbas Kiarostami (""Like Someone in Love"") "	1	1	1
"This year's festival promises to be a milestone  celebrating the NYFF's past and its future  Along with various 50th anniversary celebrations  Pena will be feted in one of two galas (the other is for Nicole Kidman  star of Lee Daniels' ""The Paperboy "" an entry in the main slate)  But the festival has also responded to a changing landscape by expanding: A three-screen theater opened last year  allowing the Film Society to broaden its offerings and add some less stuffy events  like a reunion of the cast of Rob Reiner's 1987 comedy classic  ""The Princess Bride """	2	3	1
"The 59-year-old Pena  who also teaches film at Columbia University  has seen the passion that accompanied the art house of the '60s — when films by Godard  Truffaut  Antonioni were met with fervor — wane: ""Something happened along the way there and I don't really know what it was """	1	1	2
In festival programs and retrospectives  Pena has sought to expand the horizons of contemporary cinephilia  trumpeting directors like Kiarostami  Pedro Almodovar  the Dardenne brothers  Wong Kar-wai  Hou Chao-sheng and Edward Yang 	1	2	1
"In terms of international cinema  I would love to take a bow for that  says Pena  ""But on the other hand  you have to realize  I had much greater access to that kind of work than my predecessors did  I mean  VHS tape was invented in 1985 and I came in 1988 """	1	3	1
"Rose Kuo  executive director of the Film Society  says Pena ""very much took a lead"" in bringing foreign films to Americans "	1	1	1
"Fittingly  the first festival Pena oversaw opened with Almodovar's ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown "" The Spanish director has since been a regular at the festival  In a book planned for release this fall on the festival  Almodovar writes of the resonance of the festival and its director: ""At that moment I initiated a dialogue with New York City and its cinephiles that has only increased in intensity  fun  variety and passion """	2	3	1
It was Koch  the longtime administrator of the Film Society  who hired Pena  formerly the program director at the Art Institute of Chicago  His arrival  initially in a lesser role  was promptly expanded in wake of the acrimonious exit of Richard Roud  who had been program director for the festival's first 25 years and was also hired at age 34 	1	1	3
"Things were simpler in those times and in hiring Richard  I believe I made the most important decision of my 32 years as administrator of the Film Society  says Koch  ""After the first year  I knew he would make it to 25 — and probably another 25  if he wanted to work 24/7 a few more decades """	3	2	1
Pena will be succeeded by not one but two: Programmer and sometimes documentarian Kent Jones will be director of programming of the festival  and critic Robert Koehler will be director of programming year-round for the Film Society 	1	1	1
"With three kids ranging in age from 15-24  Pena says he's ""winding down a bit"" and will likely occupy himself by organizing smaller programs here and there and doing series of lectures "	1	1	1
"I always think that there's stuff out there  he says of film  ""If you're willing to move a little bit and make a tiny bit of effort  you can discover all kinds of wonderful things """	2	3	1
At least 13 dead in suicide attack on NATO patrol in Afghanistan	1	1	4
KABUL (Reuters) - Three NATO soldiers and an Afghan interpreter were killed  along with at least nine civilians  in a suicide bomb attack on a foot patrol in volatile eastern Khost province on Monday  a NATO spokeswoman and local witnesses said 	2	1	4
A witness told Reuters that the blast involved a suicide bomber wearing police uniform  who struck as U S  soldiers patrolled the city of Khost 	1	1	3
Hospital officials said nine civilians were killed and 61 wounded 	1	1	4
The blast followed the killing of two Americans on Sunday in an exchange of fire with Afghan forces that may have been the result of a misunderstanding  taking the death toll of U S  military and civilian personnel to over 2 000 in the 11-year war 	2	1	5
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli troops killed at least two militants along the Israel-Egypt border on Friday as an attack was mounted on an Israeli patrol  Israeli media reported 	1	1	4
The troops managed to thwart a major attack in the area  Israel Radio's military affairs reporter said 	1	2	2
There was no official word from Israeli sources of any casualties among the troops 	1	2	3
LONDON (Reuters) - The surviving members of British rock band Led Zeppelin on Friday sidestepped the question of whether they would perform together again  and the closest their legions of fans may get is a film of their last concert in 2007 	1	2	2
"That has failed to materialize  and at a press conference to promote the new video of the 2007 gig  called ""Celebration Day""  lead singer Robert Plant  guitarist Jimmy Page and bass/keyboard player John Paul Jones all refused to be drawn on future plans "	1	1	2
"Asked whether they might consider reuniting  Page  considered one of the greatest guitarists in rock history  replied: ""Can I ask you a question? You've all been to see the film  Did you enjoy it?"""	2	2	1
"From a mostly partisan crowd of journalists and fans  the answer was in the affirmative  ""Then we've done our job "" added the silver-haired 68-year-old "	1	2	1
"When a reporter called out would Led Zeppelin ""do it again""  Plant simply replied: ""With you?"""	1	1	1
Their non-committal answers will mean the guessing game over one of the most eagerly awaited reunions in rock is likely to continue for some time to come 	1	2	1
"Celebration Day  directed by Dick Carruthers  is a two-hour film featuring all 16 tracks of the band's tribute gig  starting with ""Good Times Bad Times""  taking in ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Whole Lotta Love"" and concluding with ""Rock and Roll"" "	1	1	1
When tickets went on sale  an estimated 20 million people applied for 18 000 places  underlining the level of pressure the band has come under to play together more regularly 	2	2	1
HE DROVE US	1	2	1
On drums in the place of Bonham was his son Jason  a musician in his own right  who was praised by Plant and Page 	1	1	1
Plant recalled playing with Jason Bonham previously 	1	1	1
"We played with him before at his wedding  he said  ""Sadly he decided to go to bed during the wedding reception  and because I was     a friend of the family from way back I was the one who had to go up to his room and get him to get out of bed """	2	1	2
The long-haired lead singer admitted he had been reluctant to perform Stairway to Heaven  one of Led Zeppelin's most popular tracks  and arguably its most obscure in terms of the meaning of the lyrics 	2	1	2
"I struggle with some of the lyrics from particular periods of time  he explained  ""May be I was still trying to work out what I was talking about     Every other fucker is """	2	1	2
Everybody's eyes are on us waiting for it to go not so much right as wrong  said Plant  adding that the band hugged each other when the concert was over 	2	1	2
"Page recalled a ""massive"" party after the show  but the group itself ""sort of disappeared into the ether """	2	1	1
"He added that ""there might have been a handful of fixes"" to the sound in the film  ""The concert was what it was "" said Page  ""There was very little that needed to be messed about with because we'd really done it well in the first place """	2	2	1
Five years is like five minutes in Zeppelin time  he said 	2	2	1

Libyans hand over their weapons in arms collection drive	1	1	1
As the day went on  a trickle of people turned into longer lines in Tripoli and in the eastern city of Benghazi  where tents were set up in squares for military officials to collect arms  explosives and even rocket propelled grenade launchers 	2	1	1
Amid a celebratory atmosphere  women and children looked on as men queued to turn over their weapons as they listened to a military marching band and pop music 	2	3	1
We want our country to be safe and secure     We don't want to see weapons anymore  Tripoli resident Mohammed Salama said  as he stood in line to hand over a rifle 	3	3	1

Libya's new rulers have struggled to impose their authority on a country awash with weapons  and many Libyans are fed up with militias  formed during the war but which still patrol the streets and often take the law into their own hands 	3	1	3
Saad Bakar  head of a small brigade in Benghazi  handed over rifles and ammunition on Saturday  saying he was ready to disband his group 	1	1	1
We were waiting until today to make sure that the weapons go to the right place  he said 	2	2	1
In Benghazi  an organizer said more than 800 people had been registered as having come to the collection point 	1	1	1
In Tripoli  an army official did not give an exact figure but said the number had superseded expectations of around 200 people 	1	1	1
One participant said he had even heard that a tank had been handed over 	1	1	1
I want to live in a peaceful place where only the police and army have arms  Benghazi businessman Ibrahim Ali said after handing over a machine gun 	3	2	1
But he said he would still keep hold of his rifle for now 	1	1	1
When I can call the police and they are able to arrive quickly  then I can give them that weapon  he said 	3	1	1
The collection drive is a collaboration between the army and a private television station which drummed up support through live broadcasts from Tripoli and Benghazi 	1	1	1
Organizers in both cities  who said the event would be repeated in other cities  planned to raffle off prizes  including cars at the end of the day-long collection 	1	2	1
Libyan people need stability     They are handing over weapons to the military so that they are kept in the right place and not on the streets  said Yussef al-Mangoush  the army's chief-of-staff 	3	3	1

BENGHAZI  Libya (AP) — Hundreds of protesters stormed the compound of one of Libya's strongest armed Islamic extremist groups Friday  evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building as the attack that killed the U S  ambassador and four other Americans sparked a public backlash against armed groups that run rampant in the country and defy the country's new  post-Moammar Gadhafi leadership 	3	1	5
"Armed men at the administrative center for the Ansar al-Shariah militia  suspected to have led the Sept  11 attack on the U S  Benghazi consulate  first fired in the air to disperse the crowd  but eventually withdrew from the site with their weapons and vehicles after it was surrounded by waves of protesters shouting ""No to militias """	2	1	2
I don't want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders  I only want to see people in uniform  said Omar Mohammed  a university student who took part in the takeover  which protesters said was done in support of the army and police 	2	1	2
No deaths were reported in the incident  which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi in a rally against armed militias 	1	1	1
A vehicle was also burned at the compound  which was taken over by Libyan security forces after its occupants fled 	1	1	2
For many Libyans  last week's attack on the U S  Consulate in the eastern city of Benghazi was the last straw with one of the biggest problems Libya has faced since Gadhafi's ouster and death around a year ago — the multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the regular armed forces and police 	2	1	2
The militias  a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Gadhafi's regime  tout themselves as protectors of Libya's revolution  providing security where police cannot 	2	2	1
But many say they act like gangs  detaining and intimidating rivals and carrying out killings 	2	1	4
Militias made up of Islamic radicals are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by their hardline ideology 	2	1	3
No  no  to militias  the crowd chanted  filling a broad boulevard 	2	1	1
They carried banners and signs demanding that militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security 	1	1	1
Other signs mourned the killing of U S  Amb 	1	1	3
"Chris Stevens  reading  ""The ambassador was Libya's friend"" and ""Libya lost a friend """	2	1	2
Military helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead  and police mingled in the crowd  buoyed by the support of the protesters 	2	1	1
Several thousand Ansar al-Shariah supporters lined up in front of their headquarters in the face of the crowd  waving black and white banners 	1	1	1
There were some small scuffles  but mostly the two sides mingled and held discussions in the square 	2	2	2
The march was the biggest seen in Benghazi  Libya's second largest city and home to 1 million people  since the fall of Gadhafi in August 2011 	1	1	1
The unprecedented public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government  which has been unable to rein in the armed factions 	2	1	2
Many say that officials' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled the growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces 	2	1	2
Residents of another main eastern city  Darna  have also begun to stand up against Ansar al-Shariah and other militias 	1	1	1
The anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city  in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of Benghazi  has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists 	2	1	1
During the Gadhafi era  it was the hotbed of a deadly Islamist insurgency against his regime 	3	1	3
A significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna 	1	1	1
During the revolt against him last year  Gadhafi's regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and ally itself with al-Qaida 	1	1	2
But now  the residents are lashing out against Ansar al-Shariah  the main Islamic extremist group in the city 	2	1	1
"The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation	3	1	4
346 libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193 It was disastrous  said Ayoub al-Shedwi  a young bearded Muslim preacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio show he hosts "	3	1	3
Al-Shedwi said some were afraid that if they don't act to rein them in  the U S  will strike against the militias  pushing people to support the gunmen 	2	1	2
Leaders of tribes  which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya  have come forward to demand that the militias disband 	1	2	1
Tribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no longer have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests 	1	1	2
At the city's main hotel  The Jewel of Darna  tribal figures  activists  local officials and lawmakers have been meeting in recent days to come up with a plan 	1	1	1
Until when the tribes will remain silent  cried a bearded young man standing on a podium at one such meeting Thursday 	1	1	1
Militiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna 	1	1	2
On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi  a number of elderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services  were attacked  reportedly beaten or stabbed 	1	1	4
Women wear headscarves  but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face 	1	1	1
In the ancient city's narrow alleys  shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare Western songs 	2	1	1
And many are impatient with Ansar al-Shariah's talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law 	3	1	2
"The group's name means ""Supporters of Shariah Law """	1	1	1
"We are not infidels for God sake	2	1	1
346 libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193 We have no bars  no discos  we are not practicing vice in the street  said Wassam ben Madin  a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising against Gadhafi "	1	1	3
"This is not the time for talk about Shariah 	1	1	1
346 libyans-storm-militia-backlash-attack-us-225317193 Have a state first then talk to me about Shariah "	1	1	1
If they are the 'supporters of Shariah' then who are we? he said 	1	1	1
We don't want the flag of al-Qaida raised over heads  he added  referring to Ansar al-Shariah's black banner 	1	1	2
"One elder resident at the Sahaba Mosque sit-in  Ramadan Youssef  said  ""We will talk to them peacefully "	1	2	1
"We will tell them you are from us and you fought for us"" during the civil war against Gadahfi "	1	1	1
Officials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias 	2	1	2
The armed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police 	1	1	2
"So the government has created a ""High Security Committee"" aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to integration "	1	1	1
Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1 000 dinars  around $900  to join — compared to the average police monthly salary of around $200 	1	2	1
However  the militias that join still do not abide by government authority  and critics say the lure of salaries has only prompted more militias to form 	2	1	2
Officials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil war against Gadhafi at around 30 000 	1	1	1
But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several hundred thousand 	1	1	1
All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming  said Khaled Hadar  a Benghazi-based lawyer 	2	1	2
The government is only making temporarily solutions  but you are creating a disaster 	3	1	2
Light rains  sunshine to boost Ivorian cocoa harvest	1	2	1
ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Light rainfall and abundant sunshine across most of Ivory Coast's main cocoa regions last week will encourage healthy output as the new harvesting season opens  farmers and analysts said on Tuesday 	1	3	1
While improved weather in recent weeks is helping to ease worries that outbreaks of fungal disease caused by poor conditions in July and August could affect production  fears that a sweeping reform of the sector may disrupt supply persist 	2	2	2
Farmers said that most regions were primed for a healthy start to the season but continued rains and sunshine would be needed until November to ensure robust output through January 	1	2	2
In the western region of Soubre  in the heart of the Ivorian cocoa belt  one analyst reported 9 millimetres of rainfall compared with 18mm the previous week 	1	1	1
We're set to have lots of good quality cocoa for the first two months of the main crop  said Lazare Ake  who farms on the outskirts of Soubre 	2	2	1
Similar growing conditions were reported in the western regions of Duekoue  Gagnoa and Meagui and in the southern regions of Divo and Agboville 	1	1	1
In the western region of Daloa  responsible for a quarter of Ivory Coast's national output  farmers reported two good showers during the week 	1	2	1
"The flowers are still coming out 	1	1	1
347 light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance It's a good sign and that is encouraging going forward	1	2	1
347 light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance Harvesting has started on most of the plantations and there are lots of ripe and nearly ripe pods on the trees  said local farmer Laurent Kouakou "	2	2	1
In the southeastern region of Aboisso  farmers reported two light showers and abundant sunshine after two weeks without rain 	1	2	1
"More and more beans are being dried in the villages in the region	2	1	1
347 light-rains-sunshine-boost-ivorian-cocoa-harvest-143842903--finance The harvest will be good  because there is now less black pod (disease)  said Aboisso farmer Etienne Yao "	2	2	2
In the eastern region of Abengourou  one analyst reported 42mm of rains  which followed a week without showers 	1	2	1
Looking at the trees  we don't think there will be a lot of cocoa in October  but there will be lots of beans in November and December  said farmer Marcellin N'Da 	3	2	2
Lindsay Lohan Arrested For Allegedly Leaving Scene Of An Accident In New York City	1	1	2
A New York City Police Department rep told Access that she was driving a 2010 Porsche SUV into an alley at 355 West 16th Street between 8th and 9th Avenue on her way to The Dream Hotel when she allegedly struck a male pedestrian 	1	1	2
The NYPD Police Department rep also claims the man sustained a knee injury and was taken to Bellevue Hospital 	1	1	2
According to a source  the man had no visible injuries after the incident and was released from the hospital 	1	1	1

Lindsay Lohan scuffles with man in New York hotel	2	1	3
(Reuters) - Actress Lindsay Lohan was involved in a scuffle with a man at a New York hotel on Sunday  police said  over what media reports described as her demand that photos of her be deleted from his cellphone 	2	1	3
Investigators took reports from both Lohan  26  and the man  but charges appeared unlikely  said a spokeswoman for the New York City Police Department 	2	1	2
Police declined to confirm local media reports identifying the man as Christian LaBella  25  of California  a staffer with Congressman John Shimkus  an Illinois Republican 	1	1	2
Nobody's been arrested  there's no assault  the police spokeswoman told Reuters 	1	2	2
Reports were taken and both parties were able to give their account of what took place 	1	1	1
Lohan's spokesman Steve Honig earlier in the day said Lohan suffered minor injuries in what he described as an attack  and said her assailant was arrested 	2	1	2
She does not face any charges 	1	2	1
Celebrity website TMZ com  citing sources close to the actress  identified the attacker as a man Lohan met at a New York nightclub 	1	1	2
The two began arguing in Lohan's hotel room after she noticed he was taking pictures of her with his cellphone  TMZ and E! News reported 	1	1	2
Lohan told police the man threw her to the ground  climbed on top of her and tried to choke her before someone else pulled him off  TMZ said 	3	1	4
Honig declined comment on the media reports 	1	1	2
The actress  who has been in and out of court  rehab and prison in recent years  was arrested in New York last week after a pedestrian told police that her car had struck him in an alley 	1	1	3
She was charged with leaving the scene of an accident  a misdemeanor 	1	1	3
LinkedIn Introduces Twitter-Like Follow Feature for Influencers	1	2	1
The elite circle includes President Obama  GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney  physician/writer Deepak Chopra  Virgin founder/CEO Richard Branson  motivational speaker Tony Robbins and Mashable's founder/CEO Pete Cashmore  among others  Fans can follow the celebs for regular updates  just like on Twitter  However  there are some differences  There's no 140-character limit on updates and the communication is designed to be business-related 	1	2	1
"Our goal is to always make sure that there's high quality  says Dan Roth  executive editor at LinkedIn  When asked when the next round of super-influencers will be added  Roth replied  ""The answer is we don't know """	2	2	1
"LinkedIn has reason to wade cautiously into this Twitteresque feature  While fake accounts and off-subject tweets are part of that social network's charm  unleashing the same on LinkedIn could destroy its niche as a sober forum for business  As such  the activity of the initial 150 will be different than their Twitter feeds  ""People come here for a purpose "" Roth says  ""They're at work or thinking about work  It's not about their personal lives """	1	1	2

The addition of the program is the latest evolution for the nine-year-old LinkedIn  which was initially little more than an online Rolodex  Over time  the site has emerged as a social network with its own hive of activity  Twitter's decision in June to no longer let users tweet to LinkedIn may have actually helped the company overcome criticism that it's a low-engagement network: PageLever  an analytics tool for Facebook Pages  found that the Twitter disentanglement actually prompted a 1 000% increase in page referrals from Facebook  Since the Twitter breakup  LinkedIn also ushered in a redesign that made it look more like Facebook or Google+ 	2	2	2

Loretta Lynn celebrates 50 years on the Opry	1	2	1
Lynn celebrated her 50th anniversary with country music's keystone showcase on Tuesday night in front of a standing room-only crowd at the Opry House 	1	3	1
An emotional Miranda Lambert and her Pistol Annies  Lynn's sister Crystal Gayle  Lee Ann Womack and Trace Adkins were among the stars to perform for Lynn  who sat in the front row wearing a gold-sequined gown and a bashful smile 	3	3	1
Well me and my husband got into town the night before and we spent the night in the car out in front of the Grand Ole Opry at Ryman Auditorium  Lynn said during a news conference before the celebration of her 50th anniversary on the Opry 	2	1	1
And we slept and the next morning of course we didn't have any money  so the next morning we divided a doughnut 	3	1	2
Womack remembered that pile of cassette tapes that kept a lonely Texas teen company 	1	1	1
Angaleena Presley of Pistol Annies said she lost it the second that the trio stepped out on stage during soundcheck  forcing two trips to the makeup chair 	2	1	2
For me it's like I could die tomorrow and I've already been in heaven tonight  Presley said 	4	4	1
"I'm from where Loretta's from (in Kentucky) and I'm a coal miner's daughter and I grew up doing dishes to her records with my mom and have loved her since I was a little girl 	4	3	1
354 loretta-lynn-celebrates-50-years-opry-033316960 I remember coming to the Opry when I was 17 and I saw her and I was standing in the front row just hoping and dreaming I'd be there some day	4	2	1

It was the first appearance on the Opry for the Annies and Lynn said it's a night that will resonate for them forever — just like it has with her 	2	3	1
The Grand Ole Opry is different and I think any Grand Ole Opry member will say that  Lynn said 	4	2	1
When you go on the Opry it's just absolutely a different feeling and it's something that you'll never feel again 	4	4	1
Low early Windows 8 adoption numbers sound alarm bells for Microsoft	1	1	3
ComputerWorld reports on new numbers from research and analytics firm Net Applications showing that just 0 33% of all Windows-based computers ran on Windows 8 in September 	3	1	2
For comparison’s sake  ComputerWorld notes that 1 64% of Windows-based computers were running on Windows 7 the month before it was released in 2009  meaning that the early adoption rate of Windows 7 was roughly five times that of Windows 8  Needless to say  if these numbers are reflection of how people feel about Windows 8  then it adds a lot more weight to some of the harsh criticisms hardware and software vendors have been lobbing at Microsoft in recent months 	2	2	4
Low returns hurt demand at German 10-year debt sale	2	1	2
LONDON (Reuters) - Germany failed to attract enough demand to meet its 5 billion euro target at a sale of 10-year bonds on Wednesday  as a record low rate of return deterred investors despite doubts over when Spain would seek a bailout 	2	1	2
German authorities had to pick up 36 percent of the debt after commercial banks bought just 3 951 billion euros of the issue  meaning the sale was technically uncovered 	1	1	2
Uncovered auctions are not uncommon for Germany  but the scale of the Bundesbank retention was exceptionally high 	3	1	2
The bond offered a record low 1 5 percent interest rate 	1	1	1
The launch of the bond on September 5 also failed to attract enough bids to cover the amount offered 	2	1	2
"At face value it doesn't look like a good auction	3	1	2 
356 low-returns-hurt-demand-german-10-debt-sale-101433276--finance Nominal bids fell short of the 5 billion target	3	1	2
356 low-returns-hurt-demand-german-10-debt-sale-101433276--finance So once again in technical terms it is a failed auction  said Michael Leister  a strategist at Commerzbank "	3	1	3
Although  against the backdrop of the current environment and Bunds having rallied quite a bit over the past sessions  it's obviously not a good auction but also not a disaster 	3	1	3
Germany's safe-haven appeal has also been tarnished by the European Central Bank's pledge to buy bonds of struggling euro zone issuers  provided they seek aid  as part of its latest plan to curb the euro zone debt crisis 	2	2	3
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy  who is facing increasingly violent protests against austerity measures  told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Wednesday that he was ready to seek a bailout if Spain's debt financing costs stayed too high for too long 	2	1	2
The 10-year yield has risen 40 basis points since European Central Bank President Mario Draghi vowed in July to do whatever it took to save the euro 	1	1	2
He later unveiled measures in early August to buy the bonds of the bloc's struggling issuers 	1	1	1
OSLO (Reuters) - Good fortune and having children just seem to go together for Norwegian mother Hege Jeanette Oksnes 	2	2	1
Each time the 29-year old petrol station attendant from tiny Austevoll island off Norway's west coast gives birth  someone in her family wins the national lottery 	1	2	1
This is completely insane    we don't even play the lottery that often  Oksnes said only days after the family collected 12 2 million crowns ($2 12 million) with their third lottery win in six years 	3	3	1
Oksnes  who serves hot dogs at a petrol station  gave birth to her first child in 2006 just one day after her father Leif won 4 2 million crowns on the national lottery 	1	3	1
Three years later  Oksnes herself won  claiming 8 2 million crowns one day before giving birth to her second child 	1	3	1
To complete the hat-trick  Oksnes' 18-year-old brother Tord won the very same lottery this weekend  just months after she gave birth to her third child 	2	2	1
After three children though  it may be time to call it quits 	3	1	1
My husband thinks we have enough money now  she said 	2	2	1
Oksnes bought new cars with her winnings and did a bit of travelling  but has put most of the money in the bank  hoping to find a dream property to build a new house 	2	2	1

Can Magnetic Therapy Help Tinnitus Patients?	1	2	1
Researchers at Loyola University Medical Center are testing a new therapy known as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)  according to Newswise  Since 2009  it has been used to treat patients with major depression who have not been helped by at least one antidepressant 	1	3	2
Tinnitus is a ringing or noise in the ears that affects about 20 percent of the population  The Mayo Clinic says that tinnitus is actually a symptom of an underlying condition like hearing loss related to age  a circulatory system disorder  or an ear injury  Sometimes medication is the cause 	1	1	3
Patients hear unpleasant sounds even in silence: buzzing  clicking  roaring  whistling  and hissing  They can affect one or both ears  intermittently or all the time  from a low pitch to a high squeal  This annoying problem causes some patients to develop depression 	2	1	3
Most people automatically associate tinnitus with musicians  audiences  or teachers subjected to loud music  However  some of those at highest risk are military personnel  who experience loud noise in their work  according to the American Tinnitus Association  Tinnitus ranks first for veterans from all periods of service as a service-related disability 	1	1	2
During each 35- to 40-minute treatment  these currents affect mood-regulating portions of the brain  Since patients need no anesthesia or sedation  they can immediately resume normal routines  The only reported side effects are mild headaches and a tingling in the scalp  Each subject receives five treatments a week for four to six weeks and is evaluated by a doctor three times 	1	2	2
From her late 60s until her death at 81  my mother complained about a constant ringing in her ears  It was also apparent that she suffered from a significant hearing loss  When various attempts to relieve the noise failed  she took antidepressants for several years  Doctors now believe that these drugs can make tinnitus worse  If the misery she suffered was typical  it's easy to see why tinnitus patients with depression would be eager to try magnetic therapy 	3	2	4

"A Denver man has just won $7 2 million in damages from the makers and sellers of his favorite snack — microwave popcorn  Wayne Watson  59  ate bags of the stuff every day for years  and developed a potentially fatal condition known as ""popcorn lung "" What is this odd-sounding ailment  and is the company that made the treat really to blame? Here  a brief guide:"	3	2	2
"What exactly is popcorn lung?It's the informal name for a rare ailment called bronchiolitis obliterans  an irreversible respiratory illness that causes wheezing  dry cough  fatigue  and shortness of breath  Patients have scarring in the bronchioles  the lung's smallest air passageways  and the damage makes it harder for them to breathe  Some people stricken with ""popcorn lung"" require lung transplants  In severe cases  it can be fatal "	2	1	3
"Did Watson really get sick from eating popcorn?That's what he says — or at least  from inhaling popcorn fumes — and the jury sided with him  Watson says he first noticed something was wrong when he was singing in his church choir and couldn't ""sustain notes like I used to "" He went to a pulmonary specialist  who figured his problem had to be tied to something he was inhaling  On a hunch  the doctor asked Watson if he had been exposed to a lot of popcorn  Watson's jaw dropped "	2	1	2

Man fatally shoots self on TV after Arizona chase	1	1	3
PHOENIX (AP) — Authorities still haven't released the identity of a man who fatally shot himself in the head on live national television at the end of a high-speed carjacking chase that began in Phoenix and ended close to the California border 	1	1	3
The man driving a copper-colored four-door sedan stopped  ran into the desert and placed a handgun to his head and fired 	1	1	3
The man was declared dead at the scene  according to Sgt 	1	1	3
Tommy Thompson  a Phoenix police spokesman 	1	1	1
Fox News anchor Shepard Smith told viewers that the video was supposed to be on a 10-second delay so it could be cut off from airing if something went awry 	2	1	1
We really messed up  and we're all very sorry  Smith said 	4	1	2
Fox apologized for showing the violence on air 	2	1	2
We took every precaution to avoid any such live incident by putting the helicopter pictures on a five second delay  said Michael Clemente  executive vice president of news editorial 	2	1	1
Unfortunately  this mistake was the result of a severe human error and we apologize for what viewers ultimately saw on the screen 	3	1	2
More frequently than its rivals  Fox News Channel picks up car chases from its local affiliates and airs them live 	1	1	1
It's gripping television  a live mystery with no clear resolution  and often provides a short-term ratings boost as viewers tune in to see how it ends 	2	1	1
Critics say the chases themselves rarely rise to the level of national news 	2	1	1
The Phoenix station was not airing the chase live when it ended 	1	1	1
He said at least one shot hit the police vehicle but the officers escaped injury 	2	2	2
"The suspect headed west on Interstate 10  then pulled onto a dirt road near the town of Tonopah that Thompson said was ""70 to 80 miles east of the California line """	2	1	1
TV footage showed the man exiting the vehicle and running erratically in a field before putting the gun to his head and firing 	1	1	3
He then fell to the ground 	1	1	1
Efforts to revive him were not successful and he was dead at the scene  Thompson said 	2	1	3
We don't have an ID yet 	2	1	1
Smith was narrating the video and clearly had his doubts about what was being shown from the moment the man stopped the car 	3	1	1
This scares me  he said 	3	1	2
"After the man shot himself  Fox's picture quickly cut to Smith  who was shouting ""get off  get off  get off  get off """	1	1	1
Smith apologized repeatedly following the commercial break 	1	1	1
Man mounts protest on dome of St  Peter's	1	1	1
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - An Italian man clambered onto a ledge on the huge dome of St Peter's Basilica on Tuesday to stage a precarious protest against Prime Minister Mario Monti and the European Union 	3	1	3
Video footage showed the man  identified as Marcello Di Finizio  jumping over railings near the top of the 137-m- (450- ft-) high dome on Tuesday afternoon  shocking visitors taking a tour 	2	1	2
"Enough Multinationals!"" "	3	1	3
He remained on the dome into Tuesday night  flashing a strobe light as Vatican police and firefighters worked to find a way to bring him down to safety 	1	1	2
Alex Giuzio  a friend of the protester  told Reuters that Di Finizio owns a beach bar that rents out parasols and lounge chairs to sunbathers 	1	1	1
Beach workers say the plan will favour multinational companies over smaller local businesses 	3	1	2
Mannion leads Beavers past Bruins 27-20	1	2	1
(AP) — The attention entering Saturday's Oregon State-UCLA game was focused mainly on the Bruins' offense  led by one of the country's finest young quarterbacks and the nation's leading rusher 	2	1	2
The Beavers' duo of Sean Mannion and Storm Woods stole the spotlight 	3	2	2
Mannion passed for a career-high 379 yards and two touchdowns  Woods rushed for 96 yards and another score  and underdog Oregon State put the clamps on No  19 UCLA in opening its Pacific 12 Conference season by beating the Bruins 27-20 	3	2	2
It was a great job by our team  I just loved it  Riley said 	3	3	1
"That was a really good group of offensive players and a good offensive scheme and I thought we just kept playing	3	3	1
366 mannion-leads-beavers-past-bruins-27-20-002747018 When something bad happened  nobody blinked and somebody else made a play "	3	3	2
Mannion completed 24 of 35 passes with one interception and has passed for 200 or more yards in 13 straight games 	1	2	1
Woods  who carried 21 times  scored what turned out to be the deciding touchdown on a 2-yard run late in the third quarter and gained 62 of his yards after halftime 	2	2	1
Oregon State's Markus Wheaton had nine receptions for 150 yards and a touchdown and has caught at least one pass in 25 consecutive games 	1	2	1
Brandin Cooks had six catches for 175 yards and a TD for the Beavers 	1	2	1
"We've got a lot of respect for (UCLA)  they were tough start to finish	3	2	2
366 mannion-leads-beavers-past-bruins-27-20-002747018 It feels great to come out and get a team win like that "	4	3	1
Redshirt freshman Brett Hundley completed 27 of 42 passes for 372 yards and a touchdown for the Bruins 	1	2	1
UCLA's Johnathan Franklin  the country's leading rusher with a 180 3-yard average  was held to 45 yards on 12 carries 	1	2	1
He averaged 8 2 yards per carry previously this year 	1	2	1
"Our defense is awesome	4	3	1
366 mannion-leads-beavers-past-bruins-27-20-002747018 I can't say that enough  Mannion said "	3	1	1
But the Beavers (2-0  1-0) held them to 444 yards and two TDs 	1	2	1
That was a tough loss  obviously  but our hats are off to Oregon State  first-year UCLA coach Jim Mora said 	3	2	3
"That's a good defensive football team and a well-coached football team and they beat us	3	2	3
366 mannion-leads-beavers-past-bruins-27-20-002747018 They have a very good run defense	3	2	1
366 mannion-leads-beavers-past-bruins-27-20-002747018 They are big and physical up front 	2	2	1 
366 mannion-leads-beavers-past-bruins-27-20-002747018 We have lots of lessons to learn from this "	3	2	2
We'll see how we handle some adversity 	3	1	3
"I expect that we'll respond in the proper way  and we'll be ready to go next week """	3	2	1
Oregon State had played just once in the season's first three weeks  beating then-No 	1	2	1
The season opener against Nicholls State was postponed because of concerns over Hurricane Isaac 	1	1	2
Trailing 17-10  the Bruins blew two scoring chances in the third quarter 	2	1	2
First  they failed to convert a fourth-and-2 at the Oregon State 35-yard line after Anthony Barr forced a fumble by Mannion at the Beavers 43 and Tevin McDonald recovered 	2	1	2
The Bruins got another chance when Stan McKay intercepted Mannion's pass at the Beavers 48 on the next play  but they were forced to punt 	2	1	2
The Beavers then moved 88 yards on 13 plays to take a 24-10 lead  scoring Woods' short run one play after a pass interference penalty against Sheldon Price on third-and-goal 	1	2	1
We've got to figure out a way in those situations to do a better job  Mora said regarding the missed opportunities 	2	2	2
UCLA responded by getting a 1-yard sneak from Hundley that capped a 75-yard drive and made it 24-17 with 14:01 to play 	1	2	1
The Beavers got their 10-point lead back on Trevor Romaine's 17-yard field goal with 9:33 left 	1	2	1
The Bruins had a chance to get within seven points again  but Ka'imi Fairbairn was wide right on a 42-yard field goal with 7:37 to go 	2	2	2
Fairbairn kicked a 35-yarder with 1:47 left  but Oregon State recovered UCLA's onside kick and ran out all but the final five seconds	2	2	2
Romaine's 22-yard field goal on Oregon State's first possession gave the Beavers a 3-0 lead  but the Bruins tied it on a 22-yard field goal by Fairbairn early in the second quarter 	1	2	2
Oregon State  a 7½-point underdog  took the lead back on the next scrimmage play — a 75-yard touchdown pass from Mannion to Cooks 	2	2	1
Hundley threw a 65-yard touchdown pass to Shaquelle Evans with 49 seconds remaining before halftime to trim Oregon State's lead to seven points 	1	2	2

LONDON (AP) — Markets stuttered Friday as investors continued to fret over the economy of Spain  which this week announced big spending cuts it hopes will convince potential bailout creditors and investors it has a rock-solid plan to heal its public finances 	1	1	2
The positive momentum generated by Thursday's Spanish budget has ground to a halt as investors await more news out of the country  including stress test results into 14 banks that are due after European markets close 	1	2	2
The positive side to this is this could accelerate the bailout request  Erlam said 	2	2	1
Eurozone countries and the European Central Bank are prepared to help Spain financially  should it need it  but Madrid has so far put off a request 	2	2	2
By midday in Europe  shares were mixed  with Madrid's IBEX index underperforming its peers 	1	1	2
The IBEX was trading 1 1 percent lower at 7 756 	1	1	1
On Thursday  the Spanish government said it planned to cut overall spending by €40 billion ($51 billion) in 2013  a move that won a generally-positive response in financial markets 	2	2	1
Many investors think the cuts will lay the ground for Spain  the fourth largest economy in the eurozone  to seek financial help from fellow countries in the bloc and the European Central Bank 	1	2	1
However  Spain would first have to ask for financial aid from fellow eurozone countries 	1	1	2
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has balked at doing so  partly because it could require new austerity cuts 	2	1	2
The hope is that the new budget measures are enough to stem any further requirements in the event of a request for help 	2	2	1
Other financial markets were fairly subdued  with the euro up 0 2 percent at $1 2936 and a barrel of oil up 38 cents at $92 23 	1	2	2
Earlier in Asia  stocks had been buoyed by speculation that China's central bank will act soon to help the world's No  2 economy 	3	2	1
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0 4 percent to 20 840 38 	1	2	1
South Korea's Kospi added nearly 0 4 percent to 1 996 21 	1	1	1
But Japan's Nikkei 225 index lost 0 9 percent to 8 870 16 	1	1	2
Mainland Chinese shares rose ahead of an extended holiday next week 	1	2	1
The Shanghai Composite Index gained 1 5 percent to 2 086 17 and the Shenzhen Composite Index rose 1 9 percent to 853 83 	1	3	1
Benchmark oil for November delivery was up 41 cents to $92 26 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange 	1	2	1
The contract rose $1 87 to finish at $91 85 on the Nymex on Thursday 	1	2	1
In currencies  the euro rose to $1 2934 from $1 2917 late Thursday in New York 	1	2	1
Markets steady on Spain bailout hopes	1	1	1
LONDON (AP) — Financial markets steadied Friday on hopes that Spain was preparing to tap a new European aid program  a day after uncertainty about the fragile global economy dented investor sentiment 	1	2	2
Over recent weeks  markets have been buoyed by new measures to deal with Europe's debt crisis and hopes that central banks would offer new economic stimulus 	2	3	1
On Thursday  further signs emerged of worsening conditions in Europe  Japan and China  leading to a retreat for stocks  as well as the euro and oil prices 	2	1	3
Though those concerns remain  investor optimism was shored up Friday by hopes that Spain was negotiating with its partners in the eurozone on a new economic reform program 	1	2	1
Experts see the reforms as the groundwork for Madrid to request financial aid from Europe's bailout fund and central bank 	1	1	1
The plan has eased market tensions in Spain  but mainly on the assumption that Madrid will request the aid — something it has so far balked at doing 	2	2	2
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has attempted to delay making the decision for weeks now  however it appears the recent pressure from other European leaders has forced him into negotiations  said Craig Erlam  market analyst at Alpari 	3	1	1
In Europe  the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was down 0 2 percent at 5 843 while Germany's DAX rose an equivalent rate to 7 403 	1	2	2
The CAC-40 in France was flat at 3 509 but Madrid's main IBEX index rose 0 5 percent to 8 059 	1	2	2
Oil prices  which have also been under selling pressure in recent days  also recouped some losses  with the benchmark New York rate up 65 cents to $93 07 a barrel 	1	2	1
Earlier in Asia  Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index  gained 0 2 percent to 9 110 0 while China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index added 0 1 percent to 2 026 69 	1	2	1
Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0 7 percent to 20 734 94 	1	2	1
Mars Rover Curiosity Photo Reveals Crescent Moon Phobos	1	2	1
NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has been doing more than just driving around the Red Planet and taking pictures of rocks 	1	3	1
It's been doing a bit of Martian moon-gazing too 	2	2	1
The Curiosity rover's latest Mars photo captured the planet's largest Martian moon  Phobos  during a Martian evening  revealing the satellite as a faint crescent moon 	2	2	1
Moon Over Mars: I snapped a pic of one of Mars' moons  Phobos  in the twilight sky over Gale crater  NASA's Curiosity team announced on the mission's Twitter page  MarsCuriosity  writing as the rover itself  on Wednesday (Sept 	3	2	1
The photo shows Phobos as a faint white crescent that almost blends in with the Martian sky 	1	1	1
A black blemish also appears in the image  but is merely the result of a bad pixel in the image data  rover officials said 	1	1	2
Earlier this month  Curiosity snapped photos of Phobos as it crossed part of the sun  creating a partial solar eclipse on Mars 	1	2	1
Mars has two moons  Phobos and Deimos  both of which are much smaller than Earth's moon 	1	1	1
Phobos is about 14 miles wide (22 kilometers)  making it the largest Martian satellite 	1	1	1
Deimos is about 9 3 miles across (15 km) at its largest point and is farther from Mars than Phobos  	1	1	1
The Curiosity rover's Phobos photos are just part of the science work the car-size robot has been performing on Mars 	1	1	1
The rover landed inside the planet's vast Gale Crater on Aug  5 and is currently driving toward its first science destination  a location called Glenelg 	1	1	1
On Wednesday  Curiosity drove 160 feet (48 9 meters) closer to Glenelg  marking its longest single drive of its mission so far 	1	1	1
To date  the rover has covered about a quarter-mile (416 meters) on Mars 	1	1	1
NASA's Mars rover Curiosity is expected to spend at least two years exploring Gale Crater to determine if the region could have ever supported microbial life 	2	2	1

Mars Rover Finds Ancient Streambed Where Water Once Flowed	1	2	1
Photos from the Curiosity rover have revealed several different rocky outcrops that contain stones cemented into a layer of conglomerate rock 	1	2	1
Some of these stones are rounded and large  indicating that they were transported relatively long distances across the Red Planet surface by water 	1	1	1
This water flow was likely quite vigorous  perhaps akin to the flows produced by flash floods in desert areas here on Earth  researchers said 	1	1	1
From the size of gravels it carried  we can interpret the water was moving about 3 feet per second  with a depth somewhere between ankle and hip deep  Curiosity co-investigator William Dietrich  of the University of California  Berkeley  said in a statement 	1	1	1
"This is the first time we're actually seeing water-transported gravel on Mars 	1	2	1
371 mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426 This is a transition from speculation about the size of streambed material to direct observation of it "	1	2	1
The findings came after researchers studied photographs of three different outcrops inside Gale Crater  where Curiosity touched down on Aug  5 	1	1	1
The first outcrop  known as Goulburn  lies a few feet from the rover's landing site 	1	1	1
Curiosity spotted the other two — called Link and Hottah — as it's been rambling toward an area called Glenelg  its first major science target 	1	1	1
And images of Hottah  which juts from the Red Planet surface at an odd angle  pretty much sealed the deal 	2	2	1
Hottah looks like someone jack-hammered up a slab of city sidewalk  but it's really a tilted block of an ancient streambed  Grotzinger said in a statement 	1	1	2
On Earth  tilted outcrops are usually the result of tectonic activity 	1	1	1
But Hottah could have been deformed by a nearby impact or other process  Grotzinger said 	1	1	1
The water on Mars likely flowed several billion years ago  researchers said  though an exact timeframe will be tough to determine 	1	1	1
But the extent of the system that produced the outcrops — and the surrounding alluvial fan and channels — suggests that it wasn't produced in a single shot 	1	1	1
Rather  water was likely flowing over a relatively long chunk of time  scientists said 	1	1	1
I'm comfortable to argue that it's certainly beyond the thousand-year timescale  but we're still gathering data to go further with that  Dietrich told reporters today 	1	2	1
The team has not yet analyzed Link or Hottah with Curiosity's 10 different science instruments  rather  the researchers' conclusions are based on images of Mars snapped by the rover's Mast Camera 	1	1	1
But those pictures capture plenty of evidence  Grotzinger said 	1	2	1
The $2 5 billion Mars rover Curiosity is about 50 days into a roughly two-year mission to determine if the Gale Crater area has ever been capable of supporting microbial life 	1	2	2
Despite the outcrop discoveries  the six-wheeled robot's ultimate destination remains the base of Mount Sharp  a 3 4-mile-high (5 5 kilometers) mountain that rises from Gale's Center 	1	1	1
A long-flowing stream can be a habitable environment  Grotzinger said 	1	2	1
"It is not our top choice as an environment for preservation of organics  though	1	1	2
371 mars-rover-finds-ancient-streambed-where-water-once-193440426 We're still going to Mount Sharp  but this is insurance that we have already found our first potentially habitable environment "	1	2	1
Mass  chemist in drug test flap is arrested	2	1	3
BOSTON (AP) — A Massachusetts chemist accused of faking drug results  forging paperwork and mixing samples at a state police lab in a case that has thrown thousands of criminal cases into doubt was arrested Friday 	2	2	3
Dookhan's alleged mishandling of drug samples prompted the shutdown of the Boston lab last month and resulted in the resignation of three officials 	2	1	3
State police say Dookhan tested more than 60 000 drug samples involving 34 000 defendants during her nine years at the lab 	1	1	1
Defense lawyers and prosecutors are scrambling to figure out how to deal with the fallout 	3	1	3
Many more defendants are expected to be released 	1	1	3
Authorities say more than 1 100 inmates are currently serving time in cases in which Dookhan was the primary or secondary chemist 	1	1	1
Dookhan had once testified under oath that she holds a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts  but school officials have said they have no record of her receiving an advanced degree or taking graduate courses there 	1	1	3
It is unclear whether anyone else will face charges  but Dookhan's supervisors have faced harsh criticism for not removing her from lab duties after suspicions about her were first raised by her co-workers and for not alerting prosecutors and police 	2	1	3
Co-workers began expressing concern about Dookhan's work habits several years ago  but her supervisors allowed her to continue working 	2	1	2
Dookhan was the most productive chemist in the lab  routinely testing more than 500 samples a month  while others tested between 50 and 150 	1	2	2
One co-worker told state police he never saw Dookhan in front of a microscope 	1	1	2
In 2010  a supervisor did an audit of Dookhan's paperwork  but didn't retest any of her samples 	1	1	2
The audit found nothing wrong 	1	1	1
The same year  a chemist found seven instances where Dookhan incorrectly identified a drug sample as a certain narcotic when it was something else 	1	1	3
He told state police he told himself it was an honest mistake 	3	2	3
In an interview with state police late last month  Dookhan allegedly admitted faking test results for two to three years 	1	1	2
"She told police she identified some drug samples as narcotics simply by looking at them instead of testing them  a process known as ""dry labbing """	2	1	2
She also said she forged the initials of colleagues and deliberately turned a negative sample into a positive for narcotics a few times 	2	1	3
She was eventually suspended from lab duties after getting caught forging a colleague's initials on paperwork in June 2011 	3	1	3
She resigned in March as the Department of Public Health investigated 	1	1	2
The lab was run by the department until July 1  when state police took over as part of a state budget directive 	1	1	1
Dookhan told state police she just wanted to get the work done and never meant to hurt anyone 	2	1	2
I screwed up big-time  she is quoted as saying in a state police report 	3	1	2
Work by Mass  lab could taint 1 100 inmates' cases	1	1	2
BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts officials say they have identified more than 1 100 defendants serving state sentences based at least partly on drug tests by a chemist accused of failing to follow protocols and mishandling samples in a now-closed state drug lab 	2	1	3
David Meier  an attorney appointed to help sort through the legal quagmire  released the number on Monday 	3	1	3
Meier says it's unclear how many of the cases might have been tainted 	2	1	2
Meier says lawyers must bring those cases before a judge 	2	2	2
The state attorney general's office is conducting a criminal investigation 	1	1	2
Dookhan hasn't been charged 	1	2	2
Mass  lab probe starts with 1 140 inmate cases	1	1	2
BOSTON (AP) — Faced with the daunting task of evaluating more than 34 000 drug cases handled by a Massachusetts chemist accused of misconduct  prosecutors and defense attorneys are starting with 1 140 cases of people who are already serving prison sentences based on potentially tainted evidence 	2	1	3
David Meier  a defense attorney and former prosecutor appointed to help sort through the legal quagmire created by the chemist's alleged actions  on Monday turned over a list of 690 people currently serving sentences in state prisons and 450 who are currently serving sentences in county jails 	1	2	2
Samples in all of the cases were tested by chemist Annie Dookhan  who state police say failed to follow testing protocols and deliberately mishandled evidence in some cases 	3	1	3
That is our first priority  people who are presently incarcerated  he said 	3	2	2
Meier said lawyers in those cases will now have to work out resolutions on a case-by-case basis 	2	1	2
The merits and any alleged issues in any one of those cases is for prosecutors and defense attorneys and judges to determine  he said 	3	2	2
Dookhan resigned in March during an internal investigation by the state Department of Public Health  which ran the lab until state police took over on July 1 as part of a budget directive 	1	1	2
Meier  who was appointed by Gov  Deval Patrick last week  met Monday with a group of district attorneys  defense attorneys and public safety officials 	1	1	1
Since the lab was closed last month  judges in Suffolk and Norfolk counties have already begun to hear motions filed by defense attorneys seeking bail reductions for drug defendants awaiting trial in cases handled by Dookhan 	1	1	2
Prosecutors have agreed to many of those motions  citing possibly tainted evidence 	1	1	2
Dookhan hasn't been charged  but the state attorney general's office is conducting a criminal investigation 	1	1	2
On Monday  a judge in Boston agreed to put the sentences of career criminal David Huffman on hold and set bail for him at $75 000 cash  with GPS monitoring 	1	1	2
The 55-year-old Huffman had pleaded guilty in August to trafficking in heroin and cocaine  possession of oxycodone with the intent to distribute and unlawful possession of ammunition and a firearm as an armed career criminal He began serving concurrent seven- to 10-year sentences last month 	1	1	4
Huffman's lawyer  Bernard Grossberg  said the next step will likely be for the defense to ask that Huffman be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea 	1	1	2
He would not have pleaded guilty to the gun charges if it was not part and parcel of his plea on the drug charges  Grossberg said 	4	1	3
Jake Wark  a spokesman for Suffolk District Attorney Dan Conley  said prosecutors opposed the motion to put his sentence on the gun charges on hold 	2	2	2
Dookhan has not responded to repeated requests for comment 	1	1	2
"Her father  Rasheed Khan  told The Associated Press that she had been ""bullied and abused "" but he would not say by whom "	3	1	3
No one has heard her side of the story  Khan said outside his home in Kissimmee  Fla   on Saturday 	4	1	2
State police have said Dookhan failed to follow testing protocols and deliberately mishandled evidence in some cases 	1	1	3
In a letter sent to defense attorneys earlier this month  Max Stern  the president of the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers  said he was told during a meeting with state officials that Dookhan was accused of deliberately tampering with evidence  including the weight of drug samples  which can affect the length of sentences given to drug defendants 	1	1	3
Mauritius unemployment rate rises to 8 2 pct	1	1	1
PORT LOUIS (Reuters) - The unemployment rate in Mauritius rose to 8 2 percent in the second quarter  its highest level since early 2011 and up from 8 0 percent in the first three months of this year  official data showed on Monday 	1	1	1

There were also reports by local news outlets  citing unnamed sources  that Moreau is expected to plead guilty to as yet unknown federal charges possibly related to a long-running investigation into contracts to board up the city's many foreclosed homes 	2	1	2
Mayor of struggling RI city to admit corruption	2	1	3
PROVIDENCE  R I  (AP) — The longtime mayor of struggling Central Falls resigned and has agreed to plead guilty to a federal corruption charge of accepting gifts in exchange for handing out a lucrative contract to board up city houses  according to papers filed Wednesday by federal prosecutors 	2	2	3
Charles Moreau and his friend  businessman Michael Bouthillette  were charged 	1	1	2
Bouthillette was charged with one count of giving gifts  according to the documents 	2	2	2
Moreau and Bouthillette acknowledge in a plea agreement that Bouthillette paid at least in part for a furnace installed at Moreau's former Central Falls home and for renovations at a home Moreau owned in Lincoln 	1	1	1
"When city employees questioned the amounts Bouthillette was charging for the work  the documents show  Moreau dismissed the concerns  on one occasion telling an employee to ""mind his own     business """	2	1	2
Moreau  who resigned as mayor effective at noon Wednesday  did not answer calls placed to his phone and a message could not be left 	1	1	2
His lawyer  William J  Murphy  and Bouthillette's lawyer  C  Leonard O'Brien  did not immediately return calls for comment 	1	1	1
Central Falls had a deficit of more than $6 million on an annual budget of about $16 million by the time a state-appointed received filed for bankruptcy on its behalf  the first time ever in Rhode Island  in August 2011 	1	1	3
Moreau was stripped of his duties — along with his key to City Hall — about a year earlier when the state stepped in 	1	1	2
About a quarter of the city's 19 000 residents live below the poverty level  according to census data  and the city has one of the state's highest foreclosure rates 	2	1	3
Moreau has been the target of a yearslong investigation by federal and state authorities into whether he improperly accepted gifts from Bouthillette 	1	2	2
"City Council President William Benson Jr  told the AP on Wednesday he is disappointed and that he's ""sorry that it's come to this """	2	1	2
It's terrible for the city  he said 	2	1	3
Under the city charter  the president of the City Council would serve as the acting mayor 	2	1	1
But the receiver  under state law  has the powers of both the mayor and City Council 	1	1	1
Moreau was first elected to lead the state's smallest city in 2003 	1	1	1
He would have been up for election next year and planned to run again 	2	1	1
"Moreau  who sold his house in Central Falls last year but said he was staying with a friend  often referred to the receivership as a ""dictatorship """	2	1	2
Along with several City Council members  he took a challenge of the state receivership law all the way to the state Supreme Court  arguing unsuccessfully that it violated their rights as elected leaders and infringed on the city's constitutionally-protected sovereignty 	2	1	2
A report on the city's financial problems by the first receiver  Mark Pfeiffer  didn't place blame solely on Moreau or the rest of the elected leadership 	1	1	2
It cited $80 million in unfunded pension and benefits obligations  a loss in state aid and anticipated revenue that never materialized 	1	1	2
A federal judge this month signed off on a five-year recovery plan for Central Falls  paving the way for its exit from municipal bankruptcy and  eventually  the return of its elected government 	1	1	2
State Revenue Director Rosemary Booth Gallogly will determine when the elected leadership comes back  but only after she feels confident they understand and will implement the plan 	3	1	1
The budget for the current fiscal year has them returning in January 	1	1	1
She could not immediately answer questions about what will happen next given Moreau's resignation 	2	1	2

McIlroy  McDowell go to 18th to win Europe's first point	1	2	1
MEDINAH  Illinois (Reuters) - World number one Rory McIlroy and fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell had a three-hole lead disappear before rising at the 18th hole to win the first point for Europe at the Ryder Cup on Friday 	1	3	1
The duo  sent out first by Europe captain Jose Maria Olazabal  snared a critical point from Americans Jim Furyk and Brandt Snedeker when McIlroy blasted out from a bunker to five feet and McDowell sank the par putt for a 1-up victory 	3	3	1
It was a great game of golf  it really personified the Ryder Cup this morning  McDowell told reporters on the 18th green after sinking the putt that allowed Europe to finish the opening foursomes session tied 2-2 	2	3	1
We played some great golf to be 3-up and two very gutsy players come back at us with a few birdies and we're playing these last two holes all square and having to hit some quality shots down the stretch 	3	3	1
A run of six birdies in seven holes from the fourth boosted the Europeans  who led by three holes through the 12th 	1	2	1
That streak was started by a chip-in by McIlroy from behind the green at the fourth that charged up the Europeans who felt wronged after Furyk had not allowed McDowell to take relief from a ball sitting close by a sprinkler head on the second hole 	2	2	2
The Americans  however  fought back and ran off a string of three successive birdies from the 14th to level the alternate-shot match 	1	3	1
Furyk punched out through a tight lane to put the ball on the fairway and Snedeker stuck his approach shot about 15 feet from the cup 	1	1	1
McDowell's approach found a bunker below the green  but McIlroy put pressure on the U S  by blasting out to five feet 	2	2	2
Furyk's right-to-left par putt broke away just inside the hole  making McDowell's putt good for a point in the European column 	1	2	1
McDowell praised his playing partner 	1	2	1
"My job is easy  I'm playing alongside the greatest player on the planet right now  said the 2010 U S  Open champion  who described McIlroy's sand shot as ""phenomenal """	3	3	1
McIlroy returned the bouquet 	1	1	1
If I had to choose anyone on either of these two sides to have to hole that putt to win at the last  it would have to be G-Mac  the number one said about McDowell  who clinched the winning putt in Europe's victory over the U S  team two years ago in Wales 	2	2	1
HARRISBURG  Pa  (AP) — A former Penn State graduate assistant who complained he saw former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky showering with a young boy on campus in 2001 and testified at his sex abuse trial this summer sued the university on Tuesday for what he says is defamation and misrepresentation 	2	1	3
Mike McQueary's whistle-blower lawsuit claims his treatment by the university since Sandusky was arrested on child molestation charges in November has caused him distress  anxiety  humiliation and embarrassment  It seeks millions of dollars in damages 	2	1	3
Penn State spokesman Dave La Torre declined to comment on Tuesday  and McQueary's lawyer Elliot Strokoff did not return a phone message 	1	1	2
McQueary  whose contract with Penn State wasn't renewed  testified that he came upon Sandusky and the boy in a team shower in a sexually suggestive position on a Friday night in early 2001 	2	1	2
"He told jurors at Sandusky's trial he heard a ""skin-on-skin smacking sound"" and what he saw was ""more than my brain could handle "" He said the boy's hands were against a wall and Sandusky was behind him  with his midsection moving subtly "	2	1	2
"McQueary claims that the November meeting with Spanier ""clearly suggest(ed) that (McQueary) was lying in his reports and testimonies that he had reported the sexual misconduct """	2	1	2
Spanier's statements have irreparably harmed (McQueary's) reputation for honesty and integrity  and have irreparably harmed (his) ability to earn a living  especially in his chosen profession of coaching football  the lawsuit said 	2	1	2
Messages left for Spanier and his lawyer on Tuesday were not immediately returned 	1	1	2
The lawsuit said McQueary learned his contract was not being renewed  meaning he was no longer a university employee  from a news conference held in July by the university's new president  Rodney Erickson  He said his salary last year was $140 000 and his future earnings as a coach would amount to at least $4 million 	2	1	2
Sandusky  a former defensive coordinator  was convicted in June on charges he sexually abused 10 boys  some on campus  He remains jailed awaiting sentencing 	1	1	2
Eight young men testified against Sandusky  describing a range of abuse they said went from grooming and manipulation to fondling  oral sex and anal rape when they were boys  One young man testified his muffled screams from the basement of the Sandusky home in State College  where Penn State is based  went unanswered as Sandusky attacked him 	1	1	4
The 68-year-old Sandusky maintains his innocence  acknowledging he showered with boys but insisting he never molested them  Given his age and the serious nature of the crimes of which he was convicted  he's likely to receive a sentence that will keep him in prison for life 	1	1	3
Meet Baxter: A Robot With Common Sense [VIDEO]	2	1	1
Baxter is like most reliable employees -- he uses common sense to do his job  and works well with others -- except  he's a robot 	3	2	1
To be precise  Baxter robots are a new line of androids that can apply common sense behavior in manufacturing workplaces 	2	1	1
"Developed by Boston-based Rethink Robotics  Baxter automatically adapts to changing environments through cameras  sensors and software that enable it to ""'see' objects  'feel' forces and 'understand' tasks "" according to the company's website "	1	1	1
For this reason  Rethink claims that Baxter robots can safely work alongside humans 	2	1	1
They can also be trained like a person  with the robots capable of juggling multiple tasks  and learning a new one in less than 30 minutes (Check out the video above to see them in action) 	1	1	1
"Priced at $22 000 and with no integration required  Baxter robots are ""a fraction of the cost of a traditional industrial robot "" according to Rethink "	2	1	1
Baxter was specifically designed to be affordable for mid-size and small manufacturers  companies that have never been able to afford robots before 	2	1	1
The androids are ready to start work in less than one hour after they hit the factory floor  the company adds 	2	1	1
Baxter is a complete  self-contained system with application software that can be updated 	1	1	1
Rethink says it plans to offer a software development kit in early 2013 for those who want to make use of the technology 	1	1	1
Unveiled Tuesday  the robots are available on pre-order  first product shipments will begin this October 	1	1	1
Do you think Baxter robots will foster cooperation or competition?	1	1	1

Melissa announced her pregnancy in April via Twitter 	1	1	1

Should Men Be in Charge in the Bedroom?	1	1	1
Sticking to traditional gender roles could make you less comfortable and less safe in the bedroom 	2	2	1
In a new study  young adults who assumed that men should take charge during sex were less likely to feel confident in sexual situations and less perceptive to using female condoms 	1	1	2
The study  published online Sept  25 in the journal Sex Roles  involved 357 women and 126 men (ages 18-29) from a public university in the Northeast  all heterosexual and sexually active 	1	1	1
The researchers  led by Lisa Rosenthal from Yale University  gave the students a survey to measure their sexual confidence  asking them how assertive they were about getting sexual satisfaction from a partner  using a condom and taking precautions for safer sex 	1	1	1
"They also examined the students' support for social power inequalities and hierarchies based on their agreement with statements such as: ""It’s OK if some groups have more of a chance in life than others "" and ""The man should be the one who dictates what happens during sex """	1	1	1
"In the private cubicle where the students filled out their survey  there was a bowl of female condoms with a sign that read: ""Protect yourself and your partner "	1	1	1
"FREE FEMALE CONDOMS """	1	1	1
There were small pamphlets next to the bowl about how to use female condoms  which are inserted into the vagina before sex 	1	1	1
The more men and women endorsed hierarchical power dynamics  the more likely they were to believe men should dominate during sex and the less likely they were to take the free female condoms and report confidence in sexual situations  the researchers said 	1	1	1
If men believe that men should dominate sexually  this may prevent them from feeling open or comfortable discussing sexual behavior and protection with their partners or asking questions about things they may not know  which could lead to reduced sexual confidence  wrote the researchers 	2	1	2
For both women and men  the belief that men should dominate sexually could reduce interest in female condoms  because female condoms are meant to be a woman-centered source of protection and may be seen as violating the norm or belief that men should be in control of sexual situations  Rosenthal and her team explained 	2	1	1
Women in the study were generally less likely than men to believe that men should dominate in the bedroom  the study's authors noted 	2	1	1

Mexico stays on gun probe despite US report	1	1	2
MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican prosecutors say they will continue investigating the botched-gun smuggling probe known as Operation Fast and Furious even after a U S  Justice Department internal watchdog report concluded that more than a dozen officials should be disciplined 	3	1	3
In a Friday statement  the Mexican Attorney General's Office says it's looking at the document released this week to see what it could add to its own probe 	1	1	2
U S  Attorney General Eric Holder has been accused of knowing about the bungled operation  but the report cleared him and faulted mid-level and senior officials for not briefing him 	1	2	2
"Fast and Furious allowed low-level ""straw"" buyers in gun-trafficking networks to leave with loads to track the guns to major traffickers "	1	1	2

Mid-life men struggle with identity  have higher suicide risk	2	1	3
LONDON (Reuters) - Middle-aged men from disadvantaged backgrounds are 10 times more likely to commit suicide  often because they have lost a sense of identity and masculine pride  researchers said on Thursday 	3	1	4
In a report commissioned by the British helpline charity the Samaritans  health experts explored why men in their 30s  40s and 50s are at such a substantially higher risk of ending their own lives 	2	1	4
The findings suggest suicide is not simply a mental health problem  the researchers said  but also one of men's place in societies and of societies' inability to adapt to men's needs when trying to deal with depression  anxiety and other problems 	3	1	3
"While suicide is mental health issue     it is also a social and health inequality issue	3	1	3 
386 mid-life-men-struggle-identity-higher-suicide-risk-100225987 This is unjust and unreasonable  said Stephen Platt  a University of Edinburgh health policy research professor and trustee for the Samaritans  who presented the report at a briefing in London"	3	1	3
The differences we are highlighting in this report   are not ones that any civilized society should be comfortable with 	2	1	2
"It said that men in mid-life are part of a ""buffer"" generation  not sure whether to be like their older  more traditional  silent  austere fathers or like their younger  more progressive  individualistic sons "	3	2	2
The changing nature of the labor market over the last 60 years has affected working class men  it said 	3	1	2
With the decline of traditional male industries  they have lost not only their jobs but also a source of masculine pride and identity 	3	2	3
It also estimates that for every suicide  there are up to 20 attempted ones 	3	1	3
Men are more likely to commit suicide than women in almost every country in the world  and the WHO says the main risk factors are mental illness - primarily depression - and alcohol abuse  as well as violence  loss  abuse and pressures from cultural and social backgrounds 	3	1	4
The Samaritans study found that in Britain on average about 3 000 middle-aged men from disadvantaged backgrounds kill themselves each year 	2	1	3
With this in mind  we need to acknowledge that men are different to women and design services to meet their needs  so they can be more effective 	3	2	1
Middle East telcos mull alliance in Facebook fight	2	1	2
DUBAI (Reuters) - Middle East telecommunications firms are discussing the idea of creating a pan-Arab online platform that would earn them more revenue from their networks by challenging Facebook and other Internet behemoths of the West 	2	2	1
The ambitious project faces technical and financial obstacles and may never be implemented on a large scale  But proponents argue the common language and culture shared by the world's more than 350 million Arabic speakers  plus the webs of affiliated companies which Gulf operators own across the Middle East and North Africa  could make the project viable 	2	2	2
Sultan said he had proposed the idea to all major operators in the Arab world over the past 12 months 	1	2	1
Behind the proposal is a frustration shared by telecommunications firms globally: as they spend heavily to build networks  data traffic on the networks is increasing rapidly  but the firms essentially only make money from charging for access to their networks - a low-margin business 	2	1	2
"The lion's share of new revenue from traffic is being taken by so-called ""over-the-top"" (OTT) Internet companies such as Facebook  Google  Apple and Twitter  The telecommunications firms have unsuccessfully pressed them for bigger contributions to the cost of building the networks "	2	1	2
VERY DIFFICULT	1	1	2
The proposed Arab online platform would feature social media and online shopping for goods and services  including digital content such as music  video and applications  Sultan said 	1	1	1
He declined to give details  saying parts of the talks were confidential  and most other Arab telecommunications operators contacted by Reuters declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment	1	1	2
But Sheikh Mohamed Al Khalifa  chief executive of Bahrain Telecommunications Co  welcomed the idea 	1	2	1
"Telcos are beginning to look to the deployment of OTT services such as streamed TV and video-on-demand  he said  ""Such diversification (into) adjacent industries has become necessary  There are gains to be made by collaborating within our industry in the Middle East """	2	2	1
Fundamentally  it's very difficult to complete against OTT players - operators lack the agility and the core competencies as well as the brand appeal  said Guillermo Escofet  a senior analyst at Informa Telecom and Media in London 	2	1	2
They're used to running networks  not being media companies  Also  operators instinctively try to differentiate themselves from each other - it's against their DNA to work together 	2	1	2
"Operators have failed miserably every time they have tried to move up the value chain  except for in certain business-to-business services  said Pedro Oliveira  a partner at global management consultants Oliver Wyman  ""Some have tried to move into content and applications  but the war is lost already """	2	1	2
The big Western Internet firms are already popular around the Middle East  Facebook  which offers an Arabic interface  had 45 2 million users in the Arab world as of June 30  up more than 50 percent from a year earlier  according to the Arab Social Media Report  produced by the Dubai School of Government 	1	2	1
Despite pockets of innovation in the region  such as video game industries in Saudi Arabia and Jordan  and ventures developing applications for smart phones in Egypt  the Middle East has so far not come close to developing online products to rival the top Western Internet companies 	2	1	2
FEASIBLE	1	2	1
However  proponents of the telecommunications firms' online plan argue it is more feasible in the Arab world than elsewhere 	1	2	1
Only about 1 percent of the world's websites are in Arabic  according to a survey by analysts W3techs  Internet penetration lags regions such as Europe  North America and east Asia  with only about 86 million of the estimated 360 million native Arabic speakers online at end-2011  Miniwatts Marketing Group said 	1	1	1
Such figures may mean Western Internet firms are not yet so entrenched in the Middle East that they cannot be challenged  The new online platform would satisfy hunger among the region's young population for more Arabic-language content  said Sultan 	2	1	2
Another factor is the impressive geographical reach of Gulf telecommunications firms  if a few of them can agree on introducing the online platform  they may be able to roll it out quickly across more than a dozen countries 	2	1	2
Combined  Qatar Telecom  Saudi Telecom  Kuwait's Zain and the UAE's Etisalat cover 16 of the 22 Arab League countries  The other six countries are the smallest four in economic terms - Mauritania  Somalia  Djibouti and Comoros - plus war-ravaged Libya and Syria 	1	1	1
The Arab telecommunications operators' extensive distribution networks and point-of-sale advertising could help them win customers from OTT players 	2	2	1
Most Middle Eastern mobile phone subscribers are on pre-paid contracts typically topped up with scratch cards  These are sold everywhere from petrol stations to local stores  so vouchers for the online platform might easily be rolled out alongside them 	2	2	1
The reach we have to consumers and the knowledge we have of consumer behavior is vast  Sultan said 	1	2	1
Thomas Kuruvilla  managing director of consultants Arthur D  Little Middle East  said an alliance of regional telecommunications firms could form a community of social networks that was attractive to local populations 	2	2	1
However  even if the region's biggest telecommunications firms succeed with the online platform  it will be hard for smaller operators to make much money from it  said Oliveira 	2	1	2
This could consign smaller firms to serving as nothing more than low-margin pipes for the data services of the big ones 	1	1	2
"In the Gulf  Saudi Arabia  Bahrain and Kuwait have multiple telecommunications firms providing Internet access  and some of them may be the most vulnerable to becoming ""dumb pipes""  Such companies might cut access fees to their networks in an effort to win market share  Oliveira said "	2	1	2
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — An Israeli immigrant who started a signage company in his basement and spent decades building it into a successful business was among five people slain by a fired employee at a Minneapolis workplace  authorities said 	1	1	3
Among those killed were Reuven Rahamim  61  the company's founder  Rami Cooks  62  of Minnetonka  Jacob Beneke  34  of Maple Grove  Ronald Edberg  58  of Brooklyn Center  and Keith Basinski  50  a Wisconsin native who was the UPS driver 	1	1	2
No details were immediately released about why Engeldinger was fired  but Minneapolis Police Chief Tim Dolan said it appeared he singled out some victims and spared others  Engeldinger's family offered sympathy to the victims in a statement through the National Alliance on Mental Illness  It said he had struggled with mental illness for years 	1	1	2
Rahamim's family asked that the focus of the tragedy be on those killed rather than the gunman  Rahamim's son-in law  Chad Blumenfield  wrote in an email that he was born and raised on a farm in Israel and was a soldier in the Israeli Army before leaving for the U S  after the Yom Kippur War  which occurred in 1973 	1	1	3
Beneke had a wife and a young son  said Lorrie Link  who heads the Maple Grove Arts Center  She said Beneke was a volunteer there  where he displayed his work and promoted the work of other artists in the suburb northwest of Minneapolis 	1	2	1
Beneke's Facebook page said he worked as digital imaging manager at Accent Signage Systems 	1	1	1
"He was just a very cool guy  He was very creative and expressive  Link said of the New Albin  Iowa  native  ""His sculptures and paintings and drawings made us laugh """	2	2	1
"Minneapolis Police Capt  Amelia Huffman said the scene at Accent Signage Systems was ""very chaotic"" and that it was taking time for police to put together a comprehensive chronology  She said there were more than 20 people scattered in the building when Engeldinger began firing  and witnesses only saw bits of what happened "	2	1	2
Huffman said police believe Engeldinger got a letter of reprimand in the mail and came into the office Thursday afternoon  At that point  he was terminated 	1	1	2
From the best we can tell  the incident started right after Mr  Engeldinger had been fired  Huffman said  She said there was a struggle in the office and shots were fired  which employees elsewhere in the building heard  Dolan said Engeldinger used a 9mm Glock semi-automatic pistol he had owned for about a year 	2	1	2
"Police said the first 911 calls came in about 4:30 p m  Thursday  Initially  three officers responded  Dolan said the shooting was over by the time they got there  and they entered the building to find a scene he described as ""hellish "" Dolan said those three officers were put on leave to give them time to recover "	1	1	2
"It took officers a long time to secure the very large building  he said  The company had no security  and Dolan said tactical units found two people hiding ""a very long time"" after the attack began "	1	1	2
Later Thursday  SWAT teams and investigators searched Engeldinger's home in south Minneapolis  There they found a second gun and packaging for 10 000 rounds of ammunition in the house 	1	1	2
He obviously had this gun and was practicing how to use this gun  Dolan said 	2	1	2
"She said their concerns were ""much more centered around paranoid thoughts  No violence or anything like that "" The Engeldingers were not able to convince Andrew to seek treatment  she said "	1	1	2
"Andrew Engeldinger's uncle  Joe Engeldinger of New Germany  Minn   called his nephew a ""good kid"" who broke the hearts of family members when he broke off contact with them about two years ago "	2	1	2
Chuck and Carolyn Engeldinger raised Andrew and his two siblings in the Minneapolis suburb of Richfield  Joe Engeldinger said 	1	1	1
"He wasn't a monster  He wasn't  Joe Engeldinger said  ""He was a real good kid  a real good person  He had a real good heart  I don't know what made all this transpire  Hopefully the truth will come out and won't get twisted into some demented thing """	2	2	2
The Minnesota Bureau of Labor and Industry said it was the deadliest workplace shooting since the agency began tracking such events in 1992  No more than two workers had died in such a shooting before this week  according to the St  Paul Pioneer Press 	2	1	3

The image: The Weekly Standard reports that voters in Virginia are starting to receive their first mailers from the Romney campaign — and the top issue isn't the lackluster economy or the bloated budget deficit  but Lyme Disease 	1	1	1
But Lyme Disease has quickly become the most common vector-borne disease in the United States 	1	1	2
"The mailer  which describes Lyme Disease as a ""massive epidemic threatening Virginia "" promises that a President Romney would take action to bring the disease under control "	2	2	2
The mailer is apparently part of Romney's micro-targeting strategy  which seeks to engage voters on the local issues they care most about 	2	1	1
"The reaction: Well  ""it's tough to micro-target any deeper than a mailer talking about ticks "" says Tim Murphy at Mother Jones "	3	1	1

Mo  abuse case poses question of consent vs  crime	1	1	2
KANSAS CITY  Mo  (AP) — Advocates for people who engage in rough but consensual sex say they fear an abuse case unfolding in Missouri ultimately could criminalize their lifestyle 	3	1	3
Now prosecutors plan to present consensual  though violent  acts between Bagley and his own wife as evidence that Bagley has a history of sexually assaulting women 	2	1	3
"The case will include evidence of ""sadistic sexual assaults"" committed by Bagley against his wife  Marilyn  prosecutors say "	3	1	4
"Marilyn Bagley's 'consent' to the sexual assaults by Defendant Edward Bagley does not change whether the acts legally constitute assault or not 	2	1	3 
392 mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615 Pursuant to the Missouri state assault statute     consent is not a defense to assault resulting in serious physical injury  prosecutors wrote in court documents filed last month "	2	1	3
We are following this case specifically because we were hoping this issue would not come up  she said 	3	1	2
Ed Bagley  45  of Lebanon  Mo   is accused of grooming a young woman to be his sex slave starting in 2002  then keeping her captive for years while making money from her images on fetish Internet sites and forcing her to work as a dancer at strip clubs 	1	1	3
Marilyn Bagley  47  is charged with five counts  including sex trafficking and forced labor trafficking 	1	1	3
Both have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled for trial in February 	2	2	2
Four men  who said they visited Bagley's trailer to watch or take part  have pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges 	2	1	3
"Then-U S  Attorney Beth Phillips called the case one of ""the most horrific ever prosecuted in this district """	3	1	4
Advocates for the BDSM community say even the most brutal acts detailed in Bagley's federal indictment are not criminal acts  as long as there was consent 	2	2	2
But if the woman was too young or not intelligent enough to consent  as prosecutors allege  or if she initially gave consent and then changed her mind  most who spoke with the AP said that would be criminal sexual abuse 	3	1	3
It's the inclusion of Bagley's acts with his wife in the case that concerns BDSM advocates and Bagley's attorney  Susan Dill 	2	2	2
Like many people from all walks of life  my client and his wife engaged in what some might term alternative  but nonetheless  consensual sexual activity that they both enjoyed  Dill said in an email to The Associated Press 	3	2	2
The assertion that their consensual  marital sex life is evidence of prior criminal activity is nonsensical 	3	2	1
As in several other states  Missouri assault laws limit instances in which consent can be used as a defense against criminal charges when serious injuries occur 	1	1	2
Exceptions generally are made for athletic activities and the victim's occupation or professions in which the conduct and harm are reasonably foreseeable hazards 	1	1	1
"Wright's group contends ""serious physical injury"" is not well-defined under law "	2	2	2
The assessment of the seriousness of harm is often affected by judges' 'moral judgments about the iniquity of the conduct ' the organization says on its website in a section focusing on the consent issue 	3	2	2
"Courts tend to inflate the risk and harmfulness of an activity they want to denounce	3	2	2
392 mo-abuse-case-poses-consent-vs-crime-150855615 For example  any injury caused during a sadomasochistic encounter has been consistently classified as serious "	3	2	2
"Diana Adams  a New York attorney and sexual freedom activist who represents clients in alternative lifestyles  said the landmark 2003 U S  Supreme Court ruling ""Lawrence v  Texas"" that struck down a Texas anti-sodomy law ""declared we had a right to consensual sex between adults in the privacy of our own homes "" but that the law is not clearly defined "	3	2	2
In this kind of case  sometimes it's selectively applied  Adams said 	3	2	2
She said federal courts in Texas and Alabama interpreted the Lawrence decision in different ways in 2004 	2	2	2
The Texas court used the case to strike down a ban on sales of sex toys  citing Lawrence's privacy conclusion 	2	2	2
The Alabama court  however  upheld a similar ban by saying commercial sale of the toys was an issue of obscenity  not privacy 	2	1	3
"Wright notes that regardless of the legal precedent  prosecutors' attempts to present acts between Bagley and his wife as evidence in the Missouri case also comes at a time when kinky sex practices appear to be gaining broader public acceptance amid the popularity of the E L  James ""50 Shades of Grey"" bondage books "	3	2	2
Because of '50 Shades of Grey ' a lot of people are trying BDSM for the first time this year  she said 	3	2	1
We want to be sure they understand they have to do these activities consensually  and to make sure they have the skill to do them safely 	3	2	1

Mom's letter: Gillispie verbally abused son often	2	1	3
LUBBOCK  Texas (AP) — The mother of a teenager at Billy Gillispie's camp this summer claims in a letter to a top school administrator that the former Texas Tech coach repeatedly verbally abused her son 	2	1	3
"The woman wrote that other coaches at the camp told her son that Gillispie ""likes to pick someone and try to 'break them' for some reason "" according to a letter to Texas Tech's chancellor obtained Friday by The Associated Press through an open records request "	3	1	2

'Moon River' crooner Andy Williams dies at age 84	1	1	3
"ST  LOUIS (AP) — With a string of gold albums  a hit TV series and the signature ""Moon River "" Andy Williams was a voice of the 1960s  although not the '60s we usually hear about "	2	1	1
The old cliche says that if you can remember the 1960s  you weren't there  the singer once recalled 	2	1	1
Well  I was there all right  but my memory of them is blurred — not by any drugs I took but by the relentless pace of the schedule I set myself 	3	1	1
Williams' plaintive tenor  boyish features and easy demeanor helped him outlast many of the rock stars who had displaced him and such fellow crooners as Frank Sinatra and Perry Como 	2	2	1
In November 2011  when Williams announced that he had been diagnosed with bladder cancer  he vowed to return to performing the following year: His 75th in show business 	1	2	3
Williams died Tuesday night at his home in Branson following a yearlong battle with the disease  his Los Angeles-based publicist  Paul Shefrin  said Wednesday 	1	1	3
He was 84 	1	1	1
"He became a major star the same year as Elvis Presley  1956  with the Sinatra-like swing ""Canadian Sunset "" and for a time he was pushed into such Presley imitations as ""Lips of Wine"" and the No  1 smash ""Butterfly """	2	3	1
"But he mostly stuck to what he called his ""natural style "" and kept it up throughout his career "	2	1	1
"In 1970  when even Sinatra had given up and (temporarily) retired  Williams was in the top 10 with the theme from ""Love Story "" the Oscar-winning tearjerker "	3	2	1
He had 18 gold records and three platinum  was nominated for five Grammy awards and hosted the Grammy ceremonies for several years 	1	3	1
"Movie songs became a specialty  from ""Love Story"" and ""Days of Wine and Roses"" to ""Moon River """	1	1	1
"The longing Johnny Mercer-Henry Mancini ballad was his most famous song  even though he never released it as a single because his record company feared such lines as ""my huckleberry friend"" were too confusing and old-fashioned for teens "	2	2	2
"The song was first performed by Audrey Hepburn in the beloved 1961 film ""Breakfast at Tiffany's "" but Mancini thought ""Moon River"" ideal for Williams  who recorded it in ""pretty much one take"" and also sang it at the 1962 Academy Awards "	2	1	1
"Although ""Moon River"" was covered by countless artists and became a hit single for Jerry Butler  Williams made the song his personal brand "	2	1	1
In fact  he insisted on it 	2	1	1
The Andy Williams Show  which lasted in various formats through the 1960s and into 1971  won three Emmys and featured Williams alternately performing his stable of hits and bantering casually with his guest stars 	1	2	1
It was on that show that Williams — who launched his own career as part of an all-brother quartet — introduced the world to another clean-cut act — the original four singing Osmond Brothers of Utah 	1	1	1
Their younger sibling Donny also made his debut on Williams' show  in 1963 when he was 6 years old 	1	1	1
Four decades later  the Osmonds and Williams would find themselves in close proximity again  sharing Williams' theater in Branson 	1	1	1
Williams did book some rock and soul acts  including the Beach Boys  the Temptations and Smokey Robinson 	1	1	1
"On one show  in 1970  Williams sang ""Heaven Help Us All"" with Ray Charles  Mama Cass and a then-little known Elton John  a vision to Williams in his rhinestone glasses and black cape "	1	1	1
"But Williams liked him and his breakthrough hit ""Your Song"" enough to record it himself "	2	2	1
Williams' act was  apparently  not an act 	3	1	1
The singer's unflappable manner on television and in concert was mirrored offstage 	2	1	1
I guess I've never really been aggressive  although almost everybody else in show business fights and gouges and knees to get where they want to be  he once said 	3	2	2
My trouble is  I'm not constructed temperamentally along those lines	3	1	2

395 moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804 The Rolling Stones mocked the tragedy in Claudine "" a song so pitiless that it wasn't released until decades later "	2	1	3
Williams stood by her 	1	2	1
He escorted her to the courthouse  testified on her behalf and provided support for her and their children  Noelle  Christian and Robert 	1	3	1
Also in the 1970s  Williams was seen frequently in the company of Ethel Kennedy  Robert Kennedy's widow 	1	1	1
The singer denied any romantic involvement 	2	1	2
"In his memoir  Williams remembered himself as a shy boy who concealed his insecurity ""behind a veneer of cheek and self-confidence """	3	1	2
Of Wall Lake  Williams joked that it was so small  and had so little to do  that crowds would gather just to watch someone get a haircut 	2	1	2
Williams began performing with his older brothers Dick  Bob and Don in the local Presbyterian church choir 	1	1	1
Their father  postal worker and insurance man Jay Emerson Williams  was the choirmaster and the force behind his children's career 	1	1	1
When Andy was 8  Williams' father brought the kids for an audition on Des Moines radio station WHO's Iowa Barn Dance 	1	1	1
They were initially turned down  but Jay Emerson Williams and the young quartet kept returning and they were finally accepted  their show bringing them attention from Chicago  Cincinnati and Hollywood 	1	2	2
"The brothers joined Bing Crosby in recording the hit ""Swinging on a Star"" in 1944 for Crosby's film ""Going My Way "" and Andy  barely a teenager  was picked to dub Lauren Bacall's voice on a song for the film ""To Have and Have Not "" His voice stayed in the film until the preview  when it was cut because it didn't sound like Bacall's "	1	1	1
"Later the brothers worked with Kay Thompson of eventual ""Eloise"" fame  then a singer who had taken a position as vocal coach at MGM studios  working with Judy Garland  June Allyson and others "	1	1	1
After three months of training  Thompson and the Williams Brothers broke in their show at the El Rancho Room in Las Vegas to a huge ovation 	1	1	1
They drew rave reviews in New York  Los Angeles and across the nation  earning a peak of $25 000 a week 	1	2	1
"Williams  analyzing their success  once said: ""Somehow we managed to work up and sustain an almost unbearable pitch of speed and rhythm """	1	2	1
After five years  the three older brothers  who were starting their own families  had tired of the constant travel and left to pursue other careers 	1	1	1
Williams initially struggled as a solo act and was so broke at one point that he resorted to eating food intended for his two dogs 	2	1	2
"A two-year TV stint on Steve Allen's ""Tonight Show"" and a contract with Cadence Records turned things around "	1	1	1
Williams later formed his own label  Barnaby Records  which released music by the Everly Brothers  Ray Stevens and Jimmy Buffett 	1	1	1
But he acknowledged experimenting with LSD  opposed the Nixon administration's efforts in the 1970s to deport John Lennon  and  in 1968  was an energetic supporter of Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign 	1	1	1
We chose that song because he used it on the campaign trail  Williams later said of Kennedy  who had been a close friend 	2	2	1
"He had a terrible voice but he loved to sing that song	3	2	2
395 moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804 The only way I got through singing in church that day was by saying  'This is my job 	4	1	1
395 moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804 I can't let emotion get in the way of the song ' 	4	1	1
395 moon-river-crooner-andy-williams-dies-age-84-142235804 I really concentrated on not thinking about him "	4	1	1
After leaving TV  Williams headed back on the road  where his many Christmas shows and albums made him a huge draw during the holidays 	2	1	1
No more tours  Williams decreed 	3	1	1
When he arrived in 1992  the town was dominated by country music performers  but Williams changed that  building the classy  $13 million Andy Williams Moon River Theater in the heart of the city's entertainment district and performing two shows a night  six days a week  nine months of the year 	1	1	1
Only in recent years did he begin to cut back to one show a night 	1	1	1
The fact is most of my friends in L A  still think I'm nuts for coming here  he told The Associated Press in 1998 	2	1	1
He and his second wife  the former Debbie Haas  divided their time between homes in Branson and Palm Springs  where he spent his leisure hours on the golf course when Branson's theaters were dark during the winter months following Christmas 	1	1	1
Retirement was not on his schedule 	2	1	1
Williams is survived by his wife  Debbie  and his three children  Robert  Noelle and Christian 	1	1	1
More Schoolkids Get Nonmedical Exemptions from Vaccines	1	2	1
The percentage of school children obtaining exemptions from required vaccinations for nonmedical reasons is increasing  a new report says 	1	2	1
In 2011  just over 2 percent of school children were exempt from getting their vaccines for nonmedical reasons  up from about 1 percent in 2006  the report found 	1	2	2
Our results show that nonmedical exemptions have continued to increase  and the rate of increase has accelerated  in recent years  the researchers at Emory University wrote in a letter published today (Sept 	1	2	1
20) in the New England Journal of Medicine 	1	1	1
All U S  states allow children to be exempt from vaccination requirements for medical reasons — some children are allergic to vaccines  others have conditions that severely compromise their immune systems  and could make vaccination dangerous to a child's health 	1	2	3
For their report  researchers used data on vaccine exemptions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for school years 2005–2006 through 2010–2011 	1	1	1
They found that the rates of nonmedical exemptions were 2 5 times higher in states that allowed philosophical exemptions  compared with states that allowed only religious exemptions 	1	1	1
However  the rate of exemptions was rising faster in states that allowed only religious exemptions  the report said 	1	1	1
The researchers also looked at state exemption rates in terms of how difficult exemptions are for parents to get — some states use a standardized form to request exemptions and make this form available at schools  others require parents to go though the state health department  or require a specifically worded letter or notarization 	1	1	2
"Over the study period  the exemption rates were higher in states with ""easy"" exemption policies  compared with states with ""difficult"" policies "	1	2	2
In 2011  the average exemption rate in states with easy policies was 3 3 	1	1	1
percent  while it was 1 3 percent in states with difficult policies 	1	1	1
In an earlier analysis of data from 1991 through 2004  we found an increase in exemption rates only in states with philosophical exemptions and in states with easy exemption procedures  the researchers said 	1	1	1

For the first time  scientists have peered to the edge of a colossal black hole and measured the point of no return for matter 	1	1	1
A black hole has a boundary called an event horizon 	1	1	1
Once objects fall through the event horizon  they're lost forever  Shep Doeleman  assistant director of the MIT Haystack Observatory and research associate at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory  said in a statement Thursday (Sept 	2	1	1
27) 	1	1	1
"It's an exit door from our universe	2	1	1
398 mouth-giant-black-hole-measured-first-time-213546651 You walk through that door  you’re not coming back "	2	1	1
Although the event horizon is an imaginary line that's impossible to observe  astronomers have imaged the region around a giant black hole at the center of a distant galaxy  and measured  for the first time  the closest stable orbit in which matter can circle the black hole 	1	1	1
The supermassive black hole in question lies at the center of the galaxy M87  which is about 50 million light-years from our own Milky Way 	1	1	1
This behemoth black hole contains the mass of 6 billion suns 	1	1	1
Using a new observatory called the Event Horizon Telescope  which links up radio dishes in Hawaii  Arizona and California  astronomers measured that the innermost possible orbit for matter around the black hole is roughly 5 5 times the size of the black hole's event horizon 	1	1	1
This innermost orbit is about five times the size of the solar system  or 750 times the distance from Earth to the sun  Doeleman told SPACE com 	1	1	1
The distance between the Earth and the sun is nearly 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) 	1	1	1
The observations allowed the researchers to confirm that this swirling mass around the black hole is the source of the powerful jets of light seen radiating from the galaxy 	1	1	1
Many galaxies throughout the universe spot similar jets  thought to be produced by matter falling into their central black holes 	1	1	1
Until now  no telescope has had the resolution power to verify the idea 	1	1	1
The Event Horizon Telescope is a new project that aims to link as many as 50 radio dishes around the world to work in concert to image the distant universe 	1	1	1
PEMBA  Mozambique (Reuters) - It was billed as a celebration of its socialist revolution  but when Mozambique's ruling Frelimo party marked its 50th birthday this week  Marx came a distant second to Money 	3	2	2
Reflecting their anti-colonial  revolutionary roots  Frelimo leaders pointedly chose a venue in the untamed corner of southern Africa where half a century ago guerrillas launched the uprising that would lead to independence from Portugal in 1975 	2	2	2
"But beyond the symbolism of the location  in the northern province of Cabo Delgado  the obligatory use of ""Comrade"" and the AK-47 rifle that still adorns the national flag  everything at the party congress pointed to the huge wealth accruing to the political elite in the fast-growing energy producer "	2	1	3
The venue itself was a lavish complex of VIP reception rooms and cavernous dining areas  set amid a village of apartment units  two on-site banks and a hospital clinic for 2 000 guests 	2	2	1
Just to the north lies the Rovuma Basin  where U S  energy firm Anadarko and Italy's Eni are exploring some of the world's biggest untapped natural gas reserves - an estimated 130 trillion cubic feet  or enough to supply Western Europe for over a decade 	2	3	1
"To some of Mozambique's 23 million people  the talk of ""revolutionary war"" by Frelimo leader and President Armando Guebuza - known as ""Mr "	2	2	2
It is absurd to spend $8 million on a week-long conference when people are starving a block away  said Rudiger Franck  a hotel owner and Frelimo party member in Pemba  the run-down seaside town that hosted the seven-day jamboree 	3	1	3
It gives the impression that the party has lost touch with the reality of life for most of its members 	3	1	3
MINING BOOM	1	2	1
Under its first president  U S -educated sociologist Eduardo Mondlane  Frelimo struck out on a Marxist course until 1990 when  tired from civil war and under growing pressure from the West  it renounced socialism 	2	2	3
In the last decade  mostly under Guebuza  Mozambique has become a hotbed of foreign mining investment that has lifted economic growth to 7 percent a year and in 2011 made its currency the strongest performer against the dollar 	2	3	1
Brazil's Vale   for instance  has poured $2 billion into a coal mine in the northwestern region of Moatize and plans to invest $6 4 billion in the years to come 	1	3	1
Frelimo says all Mozambicans stand to benefit  yet in a country where the average person scrapes by on $400 a year  the opulence of its congress sends a conflicting message 	2	3	2
"This money never reaches the people 	3	1	3
399 mozambique-rulers-celebrate-marxist-roots-style-110442579--finance It remains in Frelimo's pocket  said Mustagibo Bachir  a Cabo Delgado member of parliament for Renamo  Frelimo's foe during a 16-year post-independence civil war "	3	1	3
Bachir sees a worrying precedent in the handling of the ruby and timber sectors in the north  which remains one of the country's poorest regions 	2	1	2
Besides Renamo  Frelimo is also facing opposition from the upstart Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM)  run by the 48-year-old mayor of Beira  Mozambique's second city with a population of half a million people 	2	1	2
Analysts say elections due in 2014 are too soon for MDM to make serious headway  but point to its popularity with young  educated and unemployed Mozambicans as a sign that it could become a force to be reckoned with later in the decade 	3	3	2
Mozambique's cashews get dose of Dutch disease	1	1	2
"MAPUTO (Reuters) - Mozambique's cashew industry is ailing  and the symptoms point to a bad bout of ""Dutch disease """	1	1	2
In a nutshell  this illness strikes an economy when the discovery of a resource such as oil draws in a flood of dollars  boosting the local currency but making all other exports uncompetitive 	2	1	2
The term was coined to explain the decline of manufacturing in the Netherlands after the discovery of North Sea oil and gas in the late 1950s 	1	1	1
In Mozambique's case  an investment boom in the nascent coal and gas sectors hoisted the metical by a whopping 33 percent against the dollar from September 2010 to the end of 2011 	2	2	1
It has since held on to the bulk of those gains 	1	1	1
Foreign direct investment soared to $2 1 billion last year - when the metical was the top-performing currency against the dollar - compared with just $7 8 million in 2010  central bank data showed 	2	2	1
While the government will welcome the money  it has crushed any cashew comeback and put the livelihood of tens of thousands of peasant farmers at risk in a country where agriculture still accounts for a third of gross domestic product 	2	1	3
The tropical southeast African nation and former Portuguese colony was once the world's top producer of the coveted nuts  but - as with most of its economy - the industry was gutted when civil war erupted after independence in 1975 	2	1	3
The end of conflict two decades ago allowed the cashew sector to sprout anew  and in 2010  sales rose to a post-war peak of 113 000 tonnes  the third-highest in Africa behind Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau  according to the Ghana-based African Cashew Alliance 	1	2	1
But sales then tumbled to 63 000 tonnes last year 	1	1	2
Market and industry players say the currency's appreciation prompted buyers in India  where most of Mozambique's cashews are processed  to search for cheaper options elsewhere 	2	1	1
Prices last year got to all time highs and that really hurts demand  said Richard Rosenblatt  of the Richard Franco Agency  a U S -based nut broker 	2	1	2
Oil-rich Angola  another former Portuguese colony on the other side of Africa  also highlights the impact of Dutch disease on agriculture 	1	1	1
Before independence in 1975 and the chaos of its civil war  Angola was the world's fourth-largest coffee producer  churning out 200 000 tonnes of beans a year 	2	1	2
Now  a decade after the fighting ended  it is vying with Nigeria to be Africa's biggest oil producer  while its coffee industry remains in a rut with annual output of a paltry 4 000 tonnes 	1	1	2
One solution being explored in Mozambique is to process its cashew nuts at home 	1	1	1
The cashew nut is consumed externally so it is the international price that dictates things  said Filomena Maiopue  director of the National Cashew Institute in the capital  Maputo 	2	1	1
Even if the government does get its act together  there is little immediate relief in store for farmers as money continues to pour in from mining giants such as Brazil's Vale to develop the Mozambique's vast coal fields 	2	1	1
Joaquin Solomon Nhantumo  a farmer in southern Mozambique  has been forced him to grow lettuce and tomatoes in his back-yard orchard to provide for himself and his eight children 	2	1	2
But he says there is only one crop that will keep him in business in the long run 	2	1	1
How Much Bandwidth Will the Vice Presidential Debate Need?	1	1	1
Centre College in Danville  Ky  is home to this year's vice presidential debate 	1	1	1
With thousands of attendees  campaign staff and reporters -- and all of their smartphones  tablets  laptops and other connected gear -- descending on campus Oct  11  it takes impressive technology and a coordinated effort to keep the data running smoothly 	2	1	1
It's also  the team admits  an estimation 	2	1	1
How is the college preparing to deliver problem-free data connections?	2	1	1
That's an eightfold increase using two single-gigabit links running simultaneously 	1	1	1
Mobile providers are also bringing in trucks to help boost the mobile phone and data signals in the immediate area 	1	1	1
For network engineers concerned about stability during a high-traffic event  redundancy is the name of the game 	2	1	1
Accordingly  Centre Network worked with several vendors to set up a temporary network that's running separate from the campus network 	1	1	1
The new network is fully redundant with four routers  multiple backbone links and multiple core paths  giving Centre College's IT staff the ability to quickly adapt is something goes wrong on debate day 	1	1	1
There's also a power redundancy -- the debate hall is run on a diesel generator  but it can be quickly switched to standard line power if there's a problem (it's quicker to switch from diesel to electric than vice-versa) 	2	1	1
And like a military tanker jet high above a field of combat  diesel gas trucks will be waiting nearby in case they need to refuel 	3	1	1
And what if something goes wrong on the provider side  like physical damage to fiber?	2	1	2
The college's staff will have support cases with CISCO  AT&T and Time Warner Cable open in advance  drastically speeding up any necessary repairs 	2	1	1
With so many connected devices  security is surely a concern 	3	1	1
Centre College's staff says they'll be using separate VLAN SSID networks for each of the campaigns as well for the media and other major groups involved with the debate 	1	1	1
Each network will use encrypted 802 11x to help keep the campaigns from spying on one another's traffic and the media from spying on the campaigns' traffic 	1	1	1
Will it all work?	2	1	1
On Thursday afternoon  Centre College invited about 120 faculty  staff and students to help test the network and look for problems 	1	1	1
A few were found and quickly fixed -- a result that built confidence among the Centre College team 	1	2	1
We discovered problems and corrected them -- and that was the goal  said Wilson 	2	2	2
"I feel much better than if everything had gone smoothly 	3	2	1 
401 much-bandwidth-vice-presidential-debate-142926957 If that happened  I would've wondered what was left uncovered "	2	1	1
The tech involved in running a nationally-televised debate has drastically changed in the last 12 years  said Art Moore  Centre College's director of information technology services 	2	1	1
The world completely has changed in the last 12 years  when it was all about analog telephone lines  said Moore 	2	1	1
Murdoch paper hacking plot trial set for next year	1	1	2
Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson were among 13 suspects who appeared in court  accused either of conspiring to intercept the voicemail messages of more than 600 people or hindering the police investigation into those claims 	1	1	3
The hearing - at London's Central Criminal Court  known as the Old Bailey - only dealt with administrative matters  not the substance of the allegations 	1	1	1
All 13 suspects heard the proposed date for their trial had been set for September 9  2013 	1	1	1
The hacking scandal has damaged the reputation of Murdoch's global media operations  raised questions about Cameron's judgment and exposed the close relations between British politicians  police and journalists 	2	1	3
By that time  Brooks had been promoted to chief executive of News International  Murdoch's British newspaper business  and was a confidante to the media mogul and a close friend to successive British prime ministers including Cameron 	2	2	1
After leaving the News of the World  Coulson was hired by Cameron  then in opposition  to be his communications chief 	1	1	1
Cameron took Coulson into government with him but Coulson later resigned 	1	1	1
None of the accused in the hacking case has yet entered a plea though Brooks and Coulson have indicated they will deny the accusations 	2	1	2
PACKED COURT	1	1	1
The dock at the Old Bailey's wood-paneled Court One  where some of Britain's most notorious criminals have gone on trial  was so full that several of the suspects had to sit on adjacent benches 	1	1	2
Brooks  instantly recognizable with her mane of long red curls was wearing a beige jacket and spoke only to confirm her presence  as did the other suspects 	1	1	1
Joining Coulson and Brooks in the dock were some of the most senior former staff from the News of the World who have been charged with conspiracy to intercept voicemails 	1	1	3
Brooks is also charged  with six others  including her husband Charlie  with conspiring to hinder police investigating the alleged phone-hacking by concealing material from them 	1	1	3
Charlie Brooks  a wealthy racehorse trainer  is an old friend of Cameron's who went to the same exclusive private school 	1	1	1
Tight restrictions were imposed on the reporting of the hearing which decided on a timetable for evidence to be disclosed 	1	1	1
The court was told that the next hearing for the cases would be on December 12 and 13 	1	1	1
Myanmar president heads to U S   seeks end to sanctions	2	2	2
(Reuters) - Myanmar's reformist president heads to the United States this week  keen to win an end to sanctions and open a new chapter in a once frosty relationship that could bring economic and geostrategic benefits to both sides 	2	3	2
After feting Nobel Peace Prize winner and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Washington last week  the United States will welcome Thein Sein  a 67-year-old former general who emerged as the unlikely catalyst for a wave of reforms that were unthinkable a year ago 	3	3	1
Thein Sein's U S  visit  the first by a Myanmar leader in 46 years  is the strongest sign yet of rapprochement between the two countries -- something that will benefit not only the cash-starved southeast Asian nation  but could help a superpower intent on boosting its political and economic muscle in a booming region 	3	3	1
Congress last week approved a bill that would allow President Barack Obama to waive a ban on U S  participation in providing development loans from international financial institutions like the World Bank to the former British colony 	2	2	1
The European Union set the pace last week in agreeing to grant Myanmar access to its Generalised System of Preferences  a scheme that allows poorer countries access to European markets without quotas or duties 	1	2	1
Presidential adviser Ko Ko Hlaing  who a diplomatic source said helped smooth the path for Thein Sein's visit  said ending the embargoes would facilitate the kind of reforms the United States has been asking for 	3	2	1
(The visit) is certainly intended to have some relaxation of restrictions and sanctions  Ko Ko Hlaing told Reuters 	3	3	2
Because they happen now to be obstacles in our reform process 	3	2	2
Suu Kyi is also in tune on sanctions with Thein Sein  the former fourth-in-command of the junta that locked her up for 15 years 	2	2	2
"She received the highest congressional medal on Wednesday and praised the president's reforms  adding Myanmar no longer needed to ""depend on U S  sanctions to keep up the momentum"" "	3	3	1
She met Obama on Wednesday 	1	1	1
"It is not known if he would also meet his Myanmar counterpart  as recommended by Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies  which said a decision not to risked being seen as unbalanced and ""a failure to appreciate the courageous role"" he has played "	3	2	1
"Thein Sein has sought to build a strong case for Washington to slash sanctions and deepen engagement with a country the Bush administration dubbed an ""outpost of tyranny"" while under the rule of reclusive generals  who viewed the U S  with suspicion "	3	2	2
Thein Sein gave amnesty last week to nearly 90 political prisoners  and sent charismatic president's office minister Aung Min to the United States to showcase peace efforts with ethnic minority rebel groups 	2	3	2
But it is not just Myanmar which stands to gain 	2	2	1
The country also known as Burma is of strategic importance to Washington in terms of its geographical location  business potential and its decades-old alliance with China 	2	2	1
Sanctions on Myanmar allowed China to command huge influence there and experts say closer U S  engagement serves Washington's unspoken goal of containing China by cosying up to poorer Southeast Asian countries with close ties to Beijing 	2	2	2
As one of Asia's last untapped frontier markets and with a population of 60 million  Myanmar also offers corporate America plentiful opportunities in energy  extractive industries  financial services  retail  hotels and tourism 	3	3	1
PepsiCo Inc  Coca-Cola and GE have already set up 	1	1	1
"It's a win-win situation for both countries and a chance to show the damage from the past can be repaired	3	3	1
403 myanmar-president-heads-u-seeks-end-sanctions-213657263--business It's therefore crucial Presidents Obama and Thein Sein meet  said Aung Thu Nyein of the Vahu Development Institute  a Myanmar think-tank "	3	2	1
Burma needs Washington's help  it fits in with the new U S  Asia policy and there's much U S  firms can do in Burma 	3	3	1
Nadine Won't Die: Storm Becomes One of 10 Longest-Lasting	1	1	2
And now  the cyclone's longevity will earn it a spot in the record books: By tonight  it will become the Atlantic Ocean's 10th longest-lasting tropical cyclone  according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) 	1	2	1
A tropical cyclone is an organized storm with winds greater than 32 mph (52 kph)  and includes tropical depressions  tropical storms and hurricanes 	1	1	1
Nadine is expected to retain tropical cyclone strength for another three to four days  in which case it could become one of the top five longest-lasting cyclones  said Dennis Feltgen  an NHC spokesman 	1	1	2
The longest-lasting Atlantic cyclone ever was the San Ciriaco Hurricane of 1899  which hung on for 28 days 	1	1	1
Nadine  which has been a cyclone for 19 days  is not expected to challenge that record  Feltgen told OurAmazingPlanet 	1	1	1
Nadine has had an interesting life 	1	2	1
Forecasters issued the first advisory for the storm on the morning of Tuesday  Sept  11 	1	1	1
Three days later  at 11 p m  on Friday  Sept  14  the storm became the eighth hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season 	1	1	2
Exactly one week later  at 11 p m  on Friday  Sept  21  forecasters at the NHC declared that Tropical Storm Nadine was no more 	1	1	1
Yet forecasters suspected the storm wasn't finished  writing that it could regenerate 	1	1	1
And indeed  Nadine did spring back to life like a meteorological zombie  and was declared to be a tropical storm again on Sunday  Sept  23 	2	1	2
On Sept  28  it was again declared a hurricane 	1	1	1
It weakened because it encountered surface waters cooler than 79 degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius)  and ingested colder  drier air  both of which slow down storms and disrupt the convection that fuels them 	1	1	1
But it picked up when it re-encountered warmer waters and began reorganizing  Feltgen said 	2	1	1
It's not unusual for storms to weaken and strengthen again  although it doesn't usually happen this far north 	1	1	1
Today (Oct 	1	1	1
1)  Nadine was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm  defined as being a rotating  organized storm with maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph) 	1	1	1
Nadine currently packs maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 kph) and is churning away about 690 miles (1 110 kilometers) west of the Azores 	1	1	1
It doesn't present any immediate threat to people on land 	1	2	1
Nadine has been a tropical storm for the seventh longest amount of time in the history of the Atlantic Ocean basin  Feltgen said 	1	1	1
The longest-lasting storm in any ocean basin was John  which began life as a hurricane in the East Pacific basin  then moved to the Northwest Pacific and was renamed as a typhoon 	1	1	1
That storm survived for 31 days in August and September 1994 	1	1	1
Nasdaq defends Facebook compensation plan in letter to SEC	1	1	1

The Navy officer who faked his own death to get out of an affair	1	1	3
In August  Navy Cmdr  Michael P  Ward II was given command of his own nuclear submarine — the culmination of a lifelong dream  A week later  he was languishing at a desk job  on his way to an official reprimand for violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice  His offense? Being a really incompetent adulterer  essentially  Ward  a 43-year-old married father  faked his own death to get out of a relationship with his 23-year-old pregnant mistress  Here's the sordid tale of one man's self-defeatingly elaborate plan to end an affair:	2	1	4
"What do we know about this relationship?According to the Navy's investigation  obtained by the AP Sept  18 under a Freedom of Information Act request  and the unidentified woman's earlier account in the Connecticut newspaper The Day  Ward (then a Virginia resident) met his lover through an online dating site last October  He initially used the alias Tony Moore  then told her his real name once they met  he claimed he and his wife were separated  He and this new girlfriend hooked up during a visit near her Norfolk  Va   home  and Ward got her pregnant  In July  after he had moved to Connecticut  they met in Washington to discuss the pregnancy  The woman then lost the baby  And then  Ward suddenly ""died """	1	1	4
"How did he fake his death?Over email  Using his own account  but posing as a colleague named ""Bob "" Ward wrote: ""He asked me to contact you if this ever happened  I am extremely sorry to tell you that he is gone  We tried everything we could to save him  I cannot say more  I am sorry it has to be this way """	1	1	4
"And how did he get caught?The woman  with her mother and sister in tow  drove three-and-a-half hours to Ward's Virginia home to offer their condolences  Instead of a grieving family  they found Jon Boyle  the new owner of the Wards' house  ""She was very surprised "" Boyle tells the AP  ""They said they wanted to offer their condolences  I said  'I don't think he's dead '"" A relative of the mistress then contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service  ""I don't want revenge here "" the woman told The Day in August  ""I want everyone to know the truth about Michael  He does not need to be commanding a submarine  He's a deceitful man "" On Sept  5  Ward was slapped with three violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice "	3	2	4
"Is this a fireable offense?Yes  Adultery  not to mention being a jerk — or  in military code  engaging in ""conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman"" — violate military rules  ""The Navy doesn't kid around with its leadership "" Rep  Joe Courtney (D-Conn ) tells the AP  ""These positions  to command submarines  are very competitive and I think the Navy is right to hold people to the highest standard "" Besides  says Nicole Fabian-Weber at The Stir  he sounds like a spineless idiot  Would you really want to put your multimillion-dollar attack sub  much less your life  in the hands of a man undone by his lack of courage to tell his mistress ""he just wasn't that into her""?"	4	3	5

NFL kickers are off to their best start ever	2	3	1
DENVER (AP) — The men in stripes have drawn so much attention this season that some interesting developments on the football field have gone largely unnoticed  like a big spike in field goal accuracy 	2	2	2
NFL teams combined for a record 2 287 points in the first three weeks of the season thanks to a record 248 touchdowns 	1	2	1
Kickers have done their part in this proliferation of points  converting 182 field goal attempts and missing just 15 for a 92 4 percent clip — the best three-week start ever 	2	3	2
The three-week mark tends to be a precursor for the entire season  with the final accuracy rate dipping two or three percentage points as the weather gets worse and the pressure rises 	2	2	2
The league-wide field goal percentage last season was 82 9 percent  second-highest all-time 	1	2	1
Through three weeks last season  the number was 85 8 percent  according to STATS LLC 	1	1	1
If this year's figure drops a similar 2 9 percentage points  it would end up at 89 5 percent  an enormous jump  statistically speaking 	2	2	2
Denver Broncos kicker Matt Prater  the most accurate kicker in league history from 50 yards and out  said he thinks this year's spike is the culmination of several factors ranging from better athletes to improved coaching and superior training 	2	2	1
Guys are just getting better and better  Prater said 	2	2	1
You get guys who are veterans in there and they learn from their mistakes and don't want to repeat them 	2	2	2
Yet  it's not just the icy veined veterans who are nailing their kicks 	2	2	1
There's more camps for kids coming up the ranks now  Prater said 	1	2	1
You can get a good head start on it 	1	2	1
They benefit from better athleticism than their predecessors  come almost exclusively from soccer backgrounds  are aided by an increased emphasis on special teams and rule changes  and even by playing some of their games indoors 	2	2	1
Coaches are starting to let more opportunities happen  which will increase the percentage  Walsh said 	2	2	1
"I just think guys are really starting to perfect what they do  and you're seeing a lot more great kickers today than you probably did in the past 	2	2	1 
414 nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl You'd have a handful of great kickers and the rest would be pretty good  but not elite  but I think there's a ton of elite kickers in the NFL right now "	2	2	1
The success rate has risen steadily from all distances  short and long  during the Super Bowl era 	1	2	1
In 1967  for instance  barely 51 percent of all field goal attempts were good 	2	1	2
Now  nine in 10 are splitting the uprights  which were moved to the back of the end zone in 1974 	1	2	1
Back then  kickers were often converted linemen who happened to have strong legs 	2	1	1
"Hall of Fame kicker Lou ""The Toe"" Groza made 54 9 percent of his field goal attempts  a percentage that would get him run off the roster today  not enshrined in Canton  Ohio "	2	2	2
Through Week 3  28 games were decided by one score  tied with 1988 for the most such games through the first three weeks 	1	1	1
Last weekend  seven games were decided in the final minute of regulation or overtime  something that's happened just once before  in 1995 	1	1	1
Five of those came down to a field goal 	1	1	1
Among the seven game-winning field goals so far was Tucker's 27-yarder as time expired that gave the Ravens the victory over the New England Patriots last weekend in a rematch of the AFC championship game 	1	2	1
In that title game  Billy Cundiff missed a 32-yard field goal in the closing seconds 	1	1	2
In the encore  Tucker — who took the job away from Cundiff in training camp — drove his kick just inside the right upright 	2	2	1
Bottom line is it went in  Tucker said 	1	2	1
"That's all I care about 	2	1	1
414 nfl-kickers-off-best-start-ever-202439020--nfl It went in "	1	2	1
It wasn't 	1	1	2
Tucker  who beat out Cundiff with a perfect preseason  attributes his success to lessons he received from head coach John Harbaugh  special teams coach Jerry Rosburg and kicking consultant Randy Brown 	2	2	1
I feel like I'm kicking the best I ever kicked  Tucker said 	3	3	1
Took a little work  took a couple of days  and now I feel like I'm striking the ball as confidently as I ever have 	3	3	1
He's not the only one who feels that way 	2	2	1
Prater's three field goals against Houston last week moved him past Jason Elam as the most accurate kicker in team history at 81 percent  and his 53-yarder made him 13 for 17 from 50 yards and out for a 76 5 percent clip  the best in league history with a minimum of 10 attempts 	1	3	1
Ryan Succop's club-record sixth field goal gave Kansas City a 27-24 win in overtime at New Orleans last weekend 	1	2	1
He was a perfect 6 for 6 on kicks ranging from 25 to 45 yards 	1	2	1
Zuerlein  a sixth-round pick out of tiny Missouri Western  is 8 for 8 on field goals  including a 56-yarder last week  one yard shy of the Rams franchise record 	2	2	1
I guess I'm just confident in my abilities  Zuerlein said 	2	2	1
But his leg speed is incredible 	2	3	1
Zuerlein said years spent playing soccer probably account for his explosive leg power  not anything he does in the weight room 	2	2	1
I can't squat a house or anything like that  Zuerlein said 	2	1	1

"Following a heinous game-ending call that handed the Seattle Seahawks a victory over the Green Bay Packers on Monday night  everyone seems to agree that the NFL has to resolve a labor dispute with the referees' union that has kept the regular refs on the sidelines  Even President Obama tweeted that ""NFL fans on both sides of the aisle hop the refs' lockout is settled soon "" while GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan  a Wisconsin native  is fuming about it on the campaign trail  But perhaps the most surprising response came from Wisconsin Gov  Scott Walker (R)  who is famous for trying to repeal collective bargaining rights of public unions in his state  Walker tweeted that the Packers game was ""painful "" and practically begged for the real refs to return  which sounded an awful lot like a pro-union statement  Has the controversy been a boon for organized labor?"	4	3	4
"And it bolsters other unions' claims: ""Never before has so much media attention been paid to a labor dispute involving so few actual laborers— the 120 NFL referees "" says Karl Taro Greenfeld at Bloomberg Businessweek  But the controversy also ""reflects a larger trend in the American workplace "" In addition to a dispute over pensions  the referees' union is rejecting a strict performance metric that is similar to a recent proposal to evaluate Chicago teachers on student test scores  Both the refs and teachers say such rigid proposals fail to take their work environment into account  and the replacement refs controversy may show that ""officiating  like teaching  is as much art as science "" ""The NFL fiasco: Why referees are like Chicago teachers"""	2	2	3
"This is actually an area of bipartisan agreement: Walker has previously said he ""has no beef with private-sector unions "" and in this case  he just seems to be advocating a ""more conciliatory approach "" says David A  Graham at The Atlantic  The most important thing is ""to get the unionized refs back on the field "" and ""on that  at least  Wisconsites should be able to find bipartisan agreement "" ""Scott Walker weighs in on another bitter labor dispute: The NFL refs"""	2	3	1
NHL  union to resume labor talks Friday	1	1	1
TORONTO (AP) — The NHL and its locked-out players are to return to the bargaining table Friday 	1	1	1
Deputy commissioner Bill Daly and NHL Players' Association special counsel Steve Fehr met Tuesday in Toronto and scheduled the session 	1	1	1
These will be the first formal negotiations since Sept  12  when the players and owners exchanged proposals 	1	1	1
Neither of those offers gained much traction and the lockout started at midnight on Sept  15 	1	1	2
NIAMEY (Reuters) - Niger will reduce the cost of fuel at the pumps by about 7 percent next year as a result of China cutting the interest rate on a loan taken out to pay for the West African country's sole oil refinery  the oil minister said on state television 	2	2	1
There have also been several strikes by taxi drivers over the cost of locally produced fuel 	2	1	2
However  the price cut at the pumps will cost the government 14 5 billion CFA francs in lost revenue  Niger's trade minister said 	2	1	2
China's Export-Import Bank agreed in July to cut the rate on the loan to 2 percent  paid back over 20 years  from a rate of Libor plus 3 1 percent over ten years 	1	1	1
"Foumakoye Gado  Niger's oil minister  said late on Thursday that the rate cut will reduce production costs at SORAZ and ""lead  in January 2013  to a 40 CFA franc reduction in the cost of fuel at the pump"" "	2	2	1
"Tax on oil-related products will be cut to 12 percent from 15 percent as part of the move  but Trade Minister Saley Saidou said: ""The decision will cost the state 6 5 billion CFA in tax receipts and it will cost the refinery 8 billion CFA """	2	1	1
The refinery  which can produce 20 000 barrels of oil a day  is 60 percent owned by China's CNPC  with Niger owning the other 40 percent 	1	1	1
Nigeria: 150 arrested in sweep against sect	1	1	2
ABUJA  Nigeria (AP) — Nigeria's military says it arrested more than 150 people and killed 36 others in a campaign across the nation's northeast to disrupt a radical Islamist sect 	1	1	5
The military swept through towns in Adamawa and Yobe states over the past few days and ordered civilians to stay indoors 	1	1	1
The military said Monday two soldiers were wounded in the operations 	1	1	3
It is unclear how effective the operation will prove against the sect  which carries out guerrilla tactics 	2	1	2
Nigerian security agencies routinely make mass arrests  but often do not catch the extremists 	2	1	2
An Associated Press count shows Boko Haram is responsible for more than 690 killings this year 	1	1	5
LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria's naira firmed slightly against the U S  dollar on Wednesday  a day after the central bank left interest rates on hold and said it would keep monetary conditions tight  dealers said 	1	2	1
Financial markets in Africa's second biggest economy were closed when the rate decision was made on Tuesday 	1	1	1
The naira opened for trade at 157 50 to the U S  dollar on Wednesday  higher than Tuesday's close of 157 75 	1	2	1
Dealers said the naira was partly driven by inflows from foreign investors buying bonds at an auction on Wednesday and oil companies selling the greenback to lenders 	1	2	1
Nigeria plans to sell 60 billion naira in bonds on Wednesday with maturities of five and seven years 	1	2	1
Olayemi Agbe-Davies  a bond dealer at Standard Chartered Bank  told Reuters debt markets had anticipated the hold decision on rates and already factored it into bond pricing  so yields were largely steady on Wednesday 	2	2	1
Nigerian central bank bars loans to big debtors post-crisis	1	2	3
LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria's central bank has banned loans to 113 firms  including the country's two major airlines  which have failed to repay debts after a 2009 financial crisis that nearly brought down the banking system  an internal document obtained by Reuters on Sunday said 	1	2	3
The companies have yet to make good on those loans  the memo said 	2	1	2
Nigeria's central bank injected $4 billion in 2009 to support nine lenders it judged to be so weakly capitalized they posed a threat to the whole economy 	2	2	3
Since then  a number of banks have been restructured  and AMCON  the Asset Management Company of Nigeria  absorbed their toxic assets 	1	2	2
As part of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)'s efforts at strengthening financial stability  it has become necessary to stop debtors who failed to repay their loans to banks and had those loans transferred to AMCON from further enjoying credit facilities     until they fully repay  the memo said 	1	2	2
Banks are prohibited from approving or disbursing any new credit facilities to all persons and organizations on this list  it said  adding that any breach would be punished by a fine equal to the value loan and possibly additional penalties 	1	2	2
Names on the list included: Zenon Petroleum  privately owned by billionaire oil tycoon Femi Otedola  the majority shareholder in listed petrol firm Forte Oil   and MRS Holdings   which holds former Chevron downstream assets and is owned by Sayyu Dantata  brother of Africa's richest man Aliko Dangote 	2	1	1
They owe 192 4 billion naira ($1 22 billion) and 120 billion naira respectively  the document said 	1	1	2
The list also included Nigeria's biggest national air carrier  Arik Air  with 85 billion in debts 	1	1	2
A spokesman for Arik Air  Ola Adebanji  said the company had not been informed 	1	1	2
Arik suspended its operations last week over a spat with unions  the airport authorities and the aviation ministry  partly over alleged unpaid dues  leaving thousands of passengers stranded 	2	1	3
The airline resumed flights on Sunday 	1	2	1
Nigeria's only other functioning major airline  Aero Contractors  was also on the list but was not immediately reachable for comment 	1	1	2
AMCON nationalized three failing banks last year 	1	1	2
It plans to refinance its 1 7 trillion naira ($10 80 billion) in repackaged bad loans into bonds when the debt expires next year 	1	2	2
The banking crisis underscored structural flaws in Nigeria's economy  where powerful oligarchs are often accused of acting above the law  diverting company funds to personal interests and failing to honor huge debts 	3	1	3
Nigeria's Boko Haram says no peace talks  spokesman arrested	1	1	2
KANO  Nigeria (Reuters) - The purported leader of Boko Haram  the Islamist sect in Nigeria  has denied government statements the group is involved in peace talks and has said its spokesman Abu Qaqa has been captured by security forces 	2	1	2
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has said the authorities were in dialogue with Boko Haram via back channels and that this was helping neutralise the threat the sect posed 	2	2	2
But Abubakar Shekau  the group's leader  said in a video posted on YouTube on Sunday that no such talks were going on 	2	1	1
Let it be clear that we never sought dialogue or to sit down with government agents or representatives     they (Nigerian leaders) will never know peace while they attack our members 	3	1	3
The sect is widely considered to be the biggest security threat in Africa's biggest oil exporter 	3	1	2
It has been blamed for more than 1 000 deaths since its insurgency - which is aimed at carving out an Islamic state in northern Nigeria - intensified in 2010 	2	1	4
Shekau also said the sect's spokesman was being detained by the security forces 	2	1	2
Our spokesman  Abu Qaqa is alive but with the security agents  but I believe strongly that after this message from me they may decide to kill him this night  Shekau said 	3	1	3
It was the first public statement on the matter by the militants since a raid  which it says led to Qaqa's arrest but not his death 	2	1	2
"Senior security sources said on September 16 that troops had killed a man identified as ""Anwal Kontagora  alias 'Abu Qaqa'""  whose pen name is often used to claim responsibility for the sect's pronouncements from its base in the northeast of the country "	2	1	3
Shekau said security forces had also begun to arrest militants' wives 	2	1	2
There were two bomb blasts on Monday in Maiduguri  the home town of Boko Haram in the remote northeast 	1	1	3
The military has often been accused of playing down the casualties Boko Haram inflicts  while exaggerating the number of sect members it kills and captures 	2	1	3
A recent military crackdown appears to have weakened the sect and there has not been a repeat of large-scale coordinated attacks seen earlier this year 	3	1	2
Nike sees China orders fall	2	1	2
(Reuters) - Nike Inc first-quarter earnings were lower than last year and orders in China for the next several months fell for the first time in three years  choking off what had been a growth engine for the world's largest sportswear maker 	2	1	3
Higher costs of materials used in Nike's shoes and T-shirts continue to hurt margins and Nike shares fell 2 9 percent in after-market trading 	2	1	3
Futures orders  or orders of Nike branded shoes and clothes scheduled for delivery from September 2012 through January 2013  rose 6 percent 	2	1	2
Last year  they were up 16 percent 	1	2	1
In China  futures orders fell 5 percent  after rising 27 percent last year 	1	2	2
The slumping orders overshadowed earnings that beat analysts' expectations 	2	2	3
Analysts on average forecast $1 12 a share  according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S 	2	1	2
No mid-life crisis for 007 as Bond films turn 50	2	2	2
"LONDON (AP) — It was a meeting of the two most famous British people on the planet: Queen Elizabeth II turned to her tuxedo-wearing guest and said  ""Good evening  Mr  Bond """	3	3	1
The pairing of these icons  the English monarch and the king of spies — in a film for the opening ceremony of the London Olympics — was a thrilling moment 	3	3	1
It scarcely mattered that one of them was fictional 	2	2	1
"Agent 007 is real to millions of moviegoers  and once again they will flock to see Bond battle for queen and country when his 23rd official screen adventure  ""Skyfall "" opens this fall "	3	3	1
"He's come a long way in the 50 years since the release — on Oct  5  1962 — of a modestly budgeted spy movie called ""Dr "	3	3	1
What's the secret of his survival?	2	2	1
Familiarity  says Roger Moore  who played Bond in seven films  more than any other actor 	2	2	1
It's sort of like a bedtime story: As long as you don't go too far away from the original  the child is happy  Moore said 	3	3	1
The audience gets what it's expecting: beautiful girls  actions  gadgets — there's a formula 	3	4	1
That fiendishly successful formula had modest beginnings 	2	2	1
"Two upstart producers  Canadian Harry Saltzman and American Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli  acquired the rights to a series of novels by Ian Fleming  a former World War II intelligence officer who had created 007 as sort of a fantasy alter-ego "	2	2	1
Saltzman and Broccoli had a budget of just $1 million  but through a blend of luck and design assembled an amazing team of on- and off-screen talent 	3	3	1
Sean Connery  a relatively unknown Scottish actor and former bodybuilder  was cast as Bond against the wishes of studio United Artists  which wanted an established star such as Cary Grant for the role 	3	2	2
Everything or Nothing  a new documentary about the Bond films  says the final seal of approval came from Cubby Broccoli's wife 	3	2	1
Is he sexy?	3	3	1
Connery got the part 	1	2	1
"In the documentary  which airs Friday on EPIX  Adam recalls feeling ""crazy with courage"" in those early days "	2	2	1
Others remember the same devil-may-care atmosphere 	2	2	2
"It was barnstorming days  said David M  Kay  whose company provided aircraft for filming and stunts on the early Bond films  including the helicopter-volcano sequence in ""You Only Live Twice """	3	3	1
"It was also enormous fun  he said — ""Men playing with boys' toys """	3	5	1
That sense of playfulness spilled over to the screen 	3	3	1
423 no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878 No arrived in movie theaters with perfect timing  as Britain swapped postwar austerity for growing prosperity "	3	3	2
Bond's world of cars  casinos and caviar was sexy  luxurious and colorful 	3	3	1
Instead of a gray  shadowy figure  here was spy as glamorous jet-setter 	3	3	1
"A lot of British films at the time were austere  black-and-white  kitchen-sink dramas	3	1	3 
423 no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878 No' exploded onto the screen  it had a pretty visceral effect on everybody "	3	3	1
Since then  Bond has survived showdowns with enemies from uber-villain Ernst Blofeld to steel-toothed assassin Jaws 	3	3	2
His survival is the result of chemistry  tenacity and luck 	3	4	1
423 no-mid-life-crisis-007-bond-films-turn-154321878 No received mixed reviews — some positive  others dismissive "	3	2	2
Pure  escapist bunk  sniffed Bosley Crowther of the New York Times 	4	1	3
"But audiences responded  and ""From Russia With Love "" released the next year  was also a hit "	2	3	1
"By 1964's ""Goldfinger "" Bond was a phenomenon "	3	5	1
From the start  success was enhanced by clever marketing 	3	3	1
In the '60s  Bond fans could wear 007 deodorant and aftershave or sport James Bond swimming trunks  complete with logo 	2	2	1
"Connery's Bond drank Smirnoff vodka  while the villain in ""Goldfinger"" played golf with Slazenger balls "	1	1	1
More than movies  these were experiences in which key elements were established  expected and anticipated 	2	2	1
The locations that spanned the globe and headed into outer space  the gravity-defying stunt sequences  the rocket belts  car-submarines and other gadgets  the megalomaniacal villains and their sadistic henchmen — all quickly became part of the Bond brand 	2	3	2
"And  of course  there were the ""Bond girls "" characters who are victims or villains but always fatefully — and often fatally — attracted to 007 "	2	3	2
Bond's scantily clad female companions have long provided ammunition for critics  who accuse the films of sexism  though others argue that the films offer eye-candy for everyone: Ursula Andress in a bikini  but also Daniel Craig in his tight blue swim trunks 	3	2	2
The films' producers at EON Productions — today run by Cubby Broccoli's daughter and stepson  Barbara Broccoli and Michael G  Wilson — have become expert at honing the formula 	2	3	1
They are masters of suspense  drip-feeding details about each new film — title  locations  guest stars — to eager fans 	3	4	1
Like its hero  the series has had many near-death experiences 	2	1	2
"There was a long-running legal battle with screenwriter Kevin McClory over rights to the ""Thunderball"" script "	3	1	2
"The result was the unofficial Bond film ""Never Say Never Again "" which saw 52-year-old Connery return after a decade away from the role "	1	2	1
"Former model George Lazenby lasted just a single film — ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" from 1969  a dark-hued tale that ranks among many fans' favorites "	2	2	1
Audiences didn't warm to Timothy Dalton's tougher  meaner 1980s Bond  but Pierce Brosnan's suave superagent — circling the globe in ever more futuristic vehicles  including an invisible car— fit with the optimistic post-Cold War era 	3	3	2
Just as 007's clothes have evolved with changing fashions — from Connery's lean '60s suits to Moore's flares to Craig's Tom Ford formalwear — producers have tried to find Bonds to mirror the mood of the times 	2	2	1
The aftermath of the Sept  11 attacks brought a change of tone 	2	1	2
"Craig's Bond  who made his debut in ""Casino Royale"" in 2006  is a darker  tougher spy who harkens back to Fleming's original  restoring sadism and self-loathing to Bond's emotional arsenal "	3	2	2
"Although the Broccoli family won't comment  media reports say Craig has committed to two more films after ""Skyfall "" with Bond 24 due for release in 2014 or 2015 — that is  if 007 continues to cheat death "	3	2	1
But Agent 007 is in pretty good shape for 50 	2	2	1
Will he last another half century?	2	2	1
Rye  the magazine editor  thinks so 	3	2	1
Bond  like diamonds  is forever  he said 	4	4	1
No place to hide as Ryder Cup pressure mounts	3	1	2
But almost to a man  members of the United States and European Ryder Cup teams who will battle at Medinah Country Club this week insist that barely gets the pulse racing compared to the heart-thumping pressure when playing for national pride 	2	1	1
In the aftermath of Europe's victory  McDowell described his U S  Open win earlier that year to a back nine stroll with his dad compared to the weighty burden he felt that day 	2	1	2
I can safely say that I don't think I can ever be more nervous on a golf course than I was that day for those last seven holes  McDowell recalled on Tuesday  the first day of official practice for this week's Ryder Cup 	2	1	2
"You're just trying not to mess up	2	1	1
424 no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf You're trying not to lose it for your team mates	2	1	1
424 no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf     Coming down the stretch that day was some of the toughest golf I had ever played in my life "	3	1	2
The Ryder Cup's team concept is a foreign but strangely alluring concept to most golfers who otherwise spend their careers focused on their own performance and bank accounts 	3	1	1
But this week 24 of the world's best players will not pocket a penny for the opportunity to put themselves through an emotional meat grinder 	4	1	1
At a tournament  if a golfer fails to make the cut  he has only to answer to himself 	1	1	1
For us to represent the United States of America and our team mates  it's something else  said Tiger Woods  who is taking part in his seventh Ryder Cup 	1	1	1
"When it gets to a certain point  either Friday afternoon  late in the evening  or Saturday late in the evening  and all the teams are gathered and there's like one group out there  and if you happen to be in that group  it's interesting	2	1	1
424 no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf It's so much heat on you "	2	2	1
"It's different than playing by yourself	1	1	1
424 no-place-hide-ryder-cup-pressure-mounts-184054205--golf Playing for team mates  it just adds an element that it means so much more because it is our country and it is our team mates "	2	1	1
GUT-CHURNING INTENSITY	1	1	2
The Ryder Cup generates the type of gut-churning intensity that can cause even golfers with the strongest knees to buckle 	3	1	2
Each Ryder Cup produces moments of truth that will test a player's nerve and in some cases define careers 	3	1	1
"At Kiawah Island in 1991  known in Ryder Cup lore as ""The War at the Shore "" Mark Calcavecchia suffered one of the biennial event's great collapses "	2	1	2
Four-up with four holes to play against Colin Montgomerie  Calcavecchia stumbled and allowed the Scotsman to escape with a half-point 	2	1	2
A disconsolate Calcavecchia walked off the 18th green to the beach where he shed a few tears but the U S  was able to end the day in celebration when Germany's Bernhard Langer  one of golf's coolest customers  missed a short putt on his final hole to hand the Americans a 14 1/2-13 1/2 victory 	2	2	2
Experience will help defuse some of the anxiety but there is no escaping the pressure that has come to characterise the Ryder Cup 	2	2	2
Experience is a big key this week  just knowing what to expect I suppose  said McDowell 	2	1	1
It was fun to be able to do it  and the aftermath and the 17th green when everyone swamped that green  it was something like I've never seen in golf before  and cool to be a part of 	2	2	1
Norwegian mass killer's speech to hit German theatre	2	2	2
BERLIN (Reuters) - A Turkish-German actress will read out Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Behring Breivik's bizarre courtroom speech in German theatres next month in an effort to highlight the widespread prevalence of far-right ideology in Europe 	2	2	2
"Swiss director Milo Rau adapted the script of ""Breivik's Explanation"" for the German stage from an audio recording of the hour-long speech the far-right nationalist gave in April before being sentenced by an Oslo court to 21 years in prison for killing 77 people last year "	2	2	2
Some notions touched on by Breivik in his justification for setting off a bomb in Oslo and shooting dozens of teenagers dead on an island retreat - that Europe and its indigenous cultures are being weakened by immigration and multiculturalism - have been helping reshape right-wing continental politics for years 	1	1	3
The theatre performances in Weimar and Berlin are intended to promote the view that while Breivik's actions were those of a madman  the ideology that drove him is shockingly widespread in democratic societies like Switzerland and Germany  the 35-year-old director told Reuters 	2	1	2
It's merely a coincidence that Breivik was the one saying it  Rau said 	1	2	1
His words could just as well have come from 60 percent of the Swiss population 	1	1	1
Citing the language of far-right Swiss nationalists who enjoy wide support in his country  Rau added that issues such as a referendum banning the construction of minarets in Switzerland exposed the parallels between Breivik's hate speech and the xenophobia in European society 	2	1	2
Breivik's words will merely be read rather than dramatised and there will be no courtroom scene  Rau said 	1	2	1
It's not a good speech and it doesn't make for good theatre either  Rau said 	1	1	2
I want to show a text and an ideology  I don't want to depict the person behind them - that's why I opted for this extremely unauthentic portrayal and very dry way of doing it 	1	2	1
Only snippets of Breivik's speech were ever made public during the proceedings in April because judges thought publishing it in its entirety would only provide Breivik with a platform for his xenophobic views 	1	1	2
There's a reason the speech wasn't allowed to leave the courtroom - so that no one tinkers around with it and makes it seem better than it was  Rau said 	1	1	2
Performances are scheduled to take place in Weimar on October 19 and in Berlin on October 27 	1	1	1
A panel discussion will follow both performances 	1	1	1

NRF: Holiday sales to rise 4 1 percent in 2012	1	2	1
NEW YORK (AP) — Americans are expected to spend more during what's traditionally the busiest shopping season of the year  but they're not exactly ready to shop 'til they drop like they have been in the past two years 	3	2	2
The National Retail Federation  the nation's largest retail trade group  said Tuesday that it expects sales during the winter holiday shopping period in November and December to rise 4 1 percent this year 	1	2	1
That's more than a percentage point lower than the growth in each of the past two years  and the smallest increase since 2009 when sales were up just 0 3 percent 	1	1	2
The projections are an important indicator for retailers that depend on the last two months of the year for up to 40 percent of their annual sales 	1	1	1
But the estimates also offer valuable insight for economists who closely watch consumer spending  which accounts for up to 70 percent of economic activity 	1	1	1
The holiday shopping season is one gauge of not only the shopping habits  but also the mindset of the average American during what has turned out to be a slow and uneven economic recovery 	2	1	2
Right now  people are feeling better about rising home prices and a rebounding stock market  but job growth is still weak and prices for everything from food to gas are higher 	2	2	2
At the same time  there's uncertainty about who the next president will be and some Americans worry that the U S  debt crisis could lead to another recession 	3	1	2
The value of her 401(k) retirement plan has risen 	1	2	1
Home sales where she lives are up again  and her neighbors are getting higher prices for their houses 	1	3	1
Still  Johnson  who's been grappling with higher food and gas prices  says the economy is still not stable enough for her to splurge during this holiday shopping season 	3	1	2
Johnson says last year  she overindulged and spent about $5 000 	3	1	1
It took until this past May to pay down her credit card debt 	1	1	1
I felt too much pressure financially  said Johnson  who works for the National Institutes of Health  a government agency that's a conglomerate of research centers 	1	1	1
I am not going to do it to myself again 	2	1	1
Still  the forecast is higher than the average growth of 3 5 percent for November and December over the past 10 years 	1	2	1
And it continues a growth trend that began after holiday sales fell 4 4 percent in 2008 during the middle of the recession 	1	2	2
It has revised every year's forecast from 2000 to reflect the change )	1	1	1
It's also higher than the 3 3 percent growth estimated by ShopperTrak  a Chicago-based analyzer of retail foot traffic  last month 	1	2	1
There have been no official numbers out on sales for that shopping period  which is typically the second biggest shopping season of the year and a barometer for what people are willing to spend during the winter holidays 	2	1	1
But Ken Perkins  president of RetailMetrics LLC  said he expects revenue at stores opened at least a year to be up 5 percent for the combined August and September months 	2	2	1
But predicting holiday spending is never easy 	2	1	1
Take last year's holiday period 	1	1	1
Overall sales were strong  but sales don't tell the whole story: Retailers' profits were eroded because they had to do a lot of discounting to get shoppers to spend  particularly during the final weeks before Christmas 	2	2	2
And all the economic variables that will likely have an impact on this year's shopping season make predicting sales that much more difficult 	2	1	2
Among them  the worry that the U S  economy will fall off into another recession next year 	1	1	3
That's when tax increases and deep spending cuts will take effect unless Congress reaches a budget deal 	3	1	2
Retailers and economists are hoping history doesn't repeat itself 	2	1	1
The last time there was such a budget battle  in August 2011  it ended with the country losing its top credit rating  nervous investors fleeing the stock market  and shoppers taking a break from buying 	3	1	3
Still  Americans are more optimistic than they have been in a long time 	1	2	1
The upcoming presidential election seems to be having an impact on how shoppers' view the economy  economists say 	1	1	1
Adding to that  Americans have seen their stock portfolios grow as The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index has surged more than 15 percent this year 	1	2	1
And national home prices were up in July 1 2 percent compared to the same month last year  according to the Standard & Poor's/Case Shiller index released last week 	1	2	1
That's the second straight year-over-year gain after two years without one 	1	2	1
Confidence has been bouncing around since the recession and the current level is still well below what's considered healthy 	2	1	2
Moreover  the spike in confidence has yet to translate into a surge in spending 	2	1	1
You have to be confident to spend  but because you're confident doesn't necessarily mean you'll spend  said Dennis Jacobe  chief economist at Gallup Poll 	3	1	1
John Challenger  CEO of Challenger  Gray & Christmas  says retailers are expected to increase holiday hiring by 6 percent to about 700 000 for the October through December period compared with a year ago  when that figure was 660 200 	3	2	1
That's well above the 324 900 hired during the financial meltdown in 2008  but still below the 746 800 level in pre-recession 2006  and well under the nearly 850 000 seasonal workers hired during the height of the dot com boom in 1999 	1	2	2
NRF predicts merchants will hire between 585 000 and 625 000 seasonal workers for the holidays 	1	2	1
And they're already starting to offer enticements to lure holiday shoppers 	1	1	1
Kmart  a division of Sears Holdings Corp   Toys R Us and Wal-Mart Stores Inc  have announced last month they're either lowering or waiving the upfront services fees for their interest-free pay-over-time program 	1	2	1

NY state senator loses election after backing gay marriage	1	1	2
Senators Roy McDonald and Stephen Saland were among four New York Senate Republicans to cast key votes last year to make New York the most populous U S  state to allow homosexual marriages 	2	2	1
After a count of absentee ballots  McDonald was determined to have lost his race while Saland narrowly won in September 13 primary elections 	2	2	2
Mark Grisanti  another Republican senator who backed the gay marriage measure  which passed New York's Republican-controlled Senate on a 33-29 vote in June 2011  won his primary race by a clear margin 	1	1	1
A fourth senator who supported the bill was not seeking re-election 	1	1	1
McDonald lost the Republican nomination in the 43rd District to Kathy Marchione  the Saratoga County clerk  in a contest that frequently touched on the issue of gay marriage 	1	1	2
Although the results are yet to be certified  Marchione had a lead of about 110 votes after a final count of absentee ballots  according to her campaign and The Saratogian newspaper 	2	2	1
About 50 votes still were awaiting adjudication by a judge 	1	1	1
Senator McDonald's vote on marriage was certainly on the minds of voters but they took even greater issue with the fact that he was telling people he would vote a certain way up to a week prior and then voted differently  said Ken Girardin  a spokesman for the Marchione campaign 	2	1	2
Saland's victory was not secured until Monday after a final tally of absentee ballots gave him a lead of a little more than 100 votes 	1	2	1
"The New York primary races were being closely watched as a measure of the tolerance Republican voters might have for candidates who deviate from the official party line  which defines marriage as being between ""one man and one woman """	1	1	1
Lawmakers in Rhode Island  Delaware and elsewhere are expected to weigh gay marriage legislation next year and some Republican backing could be needed to pass those measures 	1	1	1
Same-sex marriage has been legalized in seven states and the District of Columbia 	1	2	1
But the outcomes of the New York primaries were close enough that both opponents and supporters of same-sex marriage were able to find encouragement in the results on Tuesday 	1	1	1
"Jason McGuire  the executive director of New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms  an evangelical Christian organization that lobbies against same-sex marriage  said Marchione's victory and even Saland's narrow win should be seen as a warning to Republican legislators tempted to ""go rogue "" as he put it "	2	1	2
The fact that she came from behind with so little support shows that no amount of activist dollars can protect you from an angry electorate  he said of Marchione's victory 	2	1	2
But Lynn Faria  the interim executive director of Empire State Pride Agenda  which has lobbied in support of same-sex marriage  said Marchione's narrow win showed many Republicans are willing to back candidates who support gay unions 	2	2	1
Now that we finally know the unofficial results of our state's primary elections  even some among the most conservative of New York voters have sent a clear message that they will support elected officials who stood on the right side of history in June 2011  she said in a statement 	2	2	1

NYC to get 'world's largest' Ferris wheel	2	2	1
"NEW YORK (AP) — The Big Apple is getting another ""biggest"": The world's biggest Ferris wheel is to be built on Staten Island  in an ambitious attempt to draw tourists to what's sometimes known as the city's ""forgotten borough "" officials announced Thursday"	2	3	1
"The 625-foot-tall structure would swing higher than the Singapore Flyer  the London Eye  and a ""High Roller"" wheel planned in Las Vegas "	1	2	1
Construction is expected to begin in early 2014 on the privately financed project  which also includes a 100-shop outlet mall and a 200-room hotel 	2	2	1
The grand opening could come by the end of 2015 	1	1	1
While riding the Staten Island Ferry is a staple of many visitors' agendas  the city has long sought to entice tourists off the boat and into Staten Island  the least populous and most remote borough — one once known for hosting the world's largest landfill 	2	2	2
Australian tourists Leah Field and Adam Lica  for example  were riding the ferry Thursday for its views of the Statue of Liberty 	2	2	1
They thought they might have lunch on the Staten Island side but weren't planning to explore further 	2	2	2
Were there a giant Ferris wheel  would the couple stay to ride it?	2	2	1
Probably  he said 	2	2	1
Chuck bears the dubious distinction of having once bitten Bloomberg 	1	1	2
But Staten Island  the only one of the city's five boroughs not accessible by subway  tends to get overshadowed by its municipal neighbors  so much so that some have at times suggested it secede from the city 	2	1	2
To Staten Island resident Miatta Bryant  the wheel might bring the borough more respect 	2	3	1
People always say Staten Island is so boring 	3	1	3
The project is expected to bring $500 million in private investment to the borough's St  George waterfront  and the developers will pay the city $2 5 million a year in rent for the land 	2	3	1
NYPD is watching Facebook to fight gang bloodshed	1	3	2
NEW YORK (AP) — Police investigating two gangs called the Very Cripsy Gangsters and the Rockstarz didn't need to spend all their time pounding the pavement for leads  Instead  they fired up their computers and followed the trash talk on Facebook 	3	2	2
Rockstarz up 3-0  one suspect boasted — a reference to the body count from a bloody turf war between the Brooklyn gangs that ultimately resulted in 49 arrests last month 	2	1	4
Authorities in New York say a new generation of gang members is increasingly using social media to boast of their exploits and issue taunts and challenges that result in violence  And police and prosecutors have responded over the past several years by closely monitoring Facebook and other sites for leads and evidence 	1	2	4
On Tuesday  New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly announced plans to beef up the NYPD's cyber crackdown by expanding the use of aggressive online investigative tactics and doubling the size of the department's gang unit to 300 investigators 	3	3	2
The reinforcements will focus less on established gangs like the Bloods and Crips and more on loosely knit groups of teenagers who stake out a certain block or section of a housing project as their turf and exact vengeance on those who trespass or fail to show the proper respect 	1	1	3
By capitalizing on the irresistible urge of these suspects to brag about their murderous exploits on Facebook  detectives used social media to draw a virtual map of their criminal activity over the last three years  the commissioner said in remarks prepared for delivery at a law enforcement convention in San Diego 	3	2	4
"Examples of the public displays of digital bravado abound  In the Brooklyn case  suspects sought to intimidate informants by posting court documents containing their names  authorities said  In another throwdown  the Rockstarz posted a photo of a Very Crispy member and the comment  ""He is scared  Look at him """	1	1	3
Police say much of the potentially incriminating material they gather can be found on Facebook profiles that are public 	1	1	2
"But as part its new  stepped-up efforts  the department will refine and expand use of a tactic instrumental in the three-year Brooklyn gang investigation — having officers adopt Internet aliases  create phony profiles and seek to ""friend"" suspects to gain access to nonpublic information  officials said "	2	2	1
It's an effort that should be closely regulated  said Christopher Dunn  associate legal director for the New York Civil Liberties Union 	1	1	1
"Electronic undercover work is fine  Dunn said  ""But we worry about the ease with which the police can use deceit on the Internet to monitor private communications """	1	2	3
Police and prosecutors insist they are following strict legal protocols 	1	2	1
"When we meet with the police and we talk about investigative techniques  when they are on these social media sites  we'll give them certain directions  Ed Carroll  head of the Gang Bureau of the Brooklyn District Attorney's office  said Tuesday  ""We don't want to set up any situation where anyone is being entrapped or put in a position where they're going to agree to commit a crime """	1	2	4
In Chicago  police similarly monitor Facebook and other social media to learn what gang members are saying about shootings and other crimes  They also built a database of the city's gang members and provide commanders with software that allows them to send officers to spots where they expect a gang to retaliate for a shooting 	1	2	3
A federal judge in New York has already weighed in on the privacy issue  siding with prosecutors in a gang case in the Bronx 	1	1	1
"In a decision last month  U S  District Judge William H  Pauley wrote that defendant Melvin Colon's ""legitimate expectation of privacy ended when he disseminated posts to his 'friends' because those 'friends' were free to use the information however they wanted — including sharing it with the government """	2	1	2
Obama Fails to Deliver on Lower Premiums Pledge	1	1	3
Two new independent studies of health insurance premiums and health care spending indicate both are rising at an accelerated pace  despite President Obama's 2008 promise to contain those costs and his pledge that his health care legislation would reduce premiums 	1	1	3
Spending on health care surged 4 6 percent in 2011 - up $4 500 per person  on average - according to the nonpartisan Health Care Cost Institute 	1	1	3
That's up from a 3 8 growth rate in 2010 	1	1	1
Health insurance premiums for individuals and families also climbed year-over-year  up 3 percent ($186) on average for an individual and 4 percent ($672) on average for a family  according to the Kaiser Family Foundation 	1	1	3
During Obama's term  between 2009 to 2012  premiums have climbed $2 370 for the average family with an employer-provided plan - a rate faster than the during the previous four years under President George W  Bush  according to Kaiser 	1	1	3
Experts point to rising health care costs as the driver of increased individual spending and higher premiums 	1	1	2
During the 2008 campaign and health care reform debate in 2009  President Obama said repeatedly that his plan would bend the cost curve downward  ultimately saving the average family $2 500 per year 	2	3	1
"At a rally in Virginia in June 2008  Obama said: ""In an Obama administration  we'll lower premiums by up to $2 500 for a typical family per year """	1	3	1
We'll do it by investing in disease prevention  not just disease management  by investing in a paperless health care system to reduce administrative costs  and by covering every single American and making sure that they can take their health care with them if they lose their job  he said at the time 	1	3	2
We'll do it by the end of my first term as President of the United States 	2	2	1
"And in a debate with Sen  John McCain in October 2008: ""The only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you "	2	3	1
"And we estimate we can cut the average family's premium by about $2 500 per year "" he said "	2	3	1
Obama and Democrats enacted the Affordable Care Act  a k a 	2	2	1
Many of those cost-savings have yet to be realized 	2	1	2
"President Obama explained in response to a question from ABC News at a Sept  2010 press conference that ""bending the cost curve on health care is hard to do """	3	1	3
"I said at the time  it wasn't going to happen tomorrow  it wasn't going to happen next year	2	1	1
433 obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics It took us decades to get into a position where our health care costs were going up 6  7  10 percent a year	1	2	2
433 obama-fails-deliver-lower-premiums-pledge-171907441--abc-news-politics And so our goal is to slowly bring down those costs  he said "	2	2	2
"Obama added  ""as a consequence of us getting 30 million additional people health care  at the margins  that's going to increase our costs  we knew that "	2	1	2
Last year  I asked White House deputy chief of staff Nancy-Ann DeParle about that $2 500 in savings the president pledged 	1	1	1
She insisted families will see that savings seven years after the president said it would be achieved - by 2019 	3	2	1
"Many of the changes in the Affordable Care Act are starting this year  and in succeeding years  DeParle told ABC News  ""and by 2019 we estimate that the average family will save around $2 000 """	3	3	1
"DeParle said that the ""big increases that occurred (in 2010) were probably driven by insurance plans overestimating what the impact would be and maybe trying to take some profits upfront before some of the changes in the Affordable Care Act occur """	3	1	3
The White House did not return a call for comment about the big increases in 2011 	1	1	2
"Obama flubs line on jobs  says he's ""channeling"" Romney"	3	1	2

KENT  Ohio (Reuters) - President Barack Obama flubbed a line during a campaign speech on Wednesday  mistakenly saying he wanted to export U S  jobs  before correcting himself and jokingly blaming Republican rival Mitt Romney 	2	1	2
"In the middle of remarks to an enthusiastic crowd in the battleground state of Ohio  Obama was describing a five-point plan to boost employment and lay a ""stronger foundation"" for the U S  economy when he stumbled at a crucial word "	2	2	2
"I want to see us export more jobs  Obama said  before catching himself quickly and saying  ""Export more products """	2	1	1

Obama using voter registration to stay close in NC	1	1	1
(AP) — Dozens of volunteers armed with clipboards and voter registration forms gather at President Barack Obama's field office here every day 	1	1	1
Their mission: Fan out across the city seeking new voters in this rapidly growing state 	2	2	1
Are you registered to vote at your current address? asks Douglas Johnston  a volunteer wooing voters outside the county courthouse 	2	2	1
Do you know about early voting?	2	2	1
The effort  it seems  has borne fruit — to the tune of more than 250 000 new registered voters in North Carolina since April 2011  according to Obama's team 	2	3	1
That's more new voters than the campaign has registered anywhere else in the country 	2	2	1
It's an eye-popping total in a state that Obama won by just 14 000 votes four years ago 	2	2	1
And the flood of new voters — presumably a chunk of them Democrats — could help keep North Carolina within the president's reach in a year when everything else here seems to be working in Republican Mitt Romney's favor 	2	2	1
North Carolina has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate just twice in 40 years 	1	1	1
The state's economy is abysmal  its 9 7 percent unemployment rate is among the nation's highest 	3	1	3
And the president's embrace of gay marriage put him at odds with a majority of North Carolina voters  including many blacks  who make up the core of his support here 	2	1	2
But less than six weeks from Election Day  Romney is spending millions of dollars in television advertising in North Carolina  defending territory that remains more conservative than most of the states that will decide the election 	2	1	1
That raises questions about his chances in places like Ohio  Florida and Virginia  where polls show him trailing the president 	2	1	1
Compared with Obama  Romney has fewer paths to victory in the state-by-state contest to cobble together enough wins to reach the requisite 270 Electoral College votes 	1	1	1
That makes North Carolina's 15 electoral votes more important to him than to Obama  who could still win the White House without a North Carolina victory 	2	1	1
Romney's campaign won't say how many new voters they have registered in the state 	1	1	1
Democrats have long outnumbered Republicans in the state  even though voters sided with GOP presidential candidates for decades 	1	1	1
And Democratic registration has fallen by about 90 000 since the end of 2008  while unaffiliated voters have increased by more than 250 000 	1	1	1
A shortage of independent polls in North Carolina makes the state's status 40 days out hard to judge 	2	1	1
But he expressed confidence that the lagging economy would help the Republican win a close contest 	2	2	2
North Carolina's rapid transition from a GOP stalwart to a presidential battleground has largely been due to increased voter registration of new African-American and Hispanic residents  as well as of transplants from the Northeast 	2	1	1
And Walter Woody III  who recently turned 18 and is eligible to vote for the first time 	1	1	1
It seems like no matter what race you are  people are starting to get more Democratic  said Woody  who is black  after he finished filling out a registration form 	2	1	1
This year  Romney's campaign was determined not to get caught off guard in North Carolina like GOP nominee John McCain was four years ago 	1	1	1
Republicans have built a more substantial ground operation here  but still trail Obama in manpower 	2	1	1
The president has 53 field offices across North Carolina to Romney's 24 	1	1	1
Paul Shumaker  a Republican consultant who has handled statewide races  said those voters may present just as many problems for Romney as the Democrats 	2	1	1
Theresa Jeffers is one of the unaffiliated voters siding with Romney — though she says it's more a vote against Obama than in favor of the Republican 	2	2	2
I was hoping so much that he would be successful  Jeffers  64  said of the president 	2	2	2
She said she's been disappointed by his performance in office  particularly on the debt 	2	1	2
Romney is hoping millions of dollars in television advertisements will convince more voters like Jeffers to side with him 	2	1	1
The candidate and his GOP allies have spent more than $32 million on ads in North Carolina  including $2 million last week alone 	1	1	1
Obama and Democrats have spent nearly $18 million on North Carolina advertising 	1	1	1
Obama's campaign is also not running the costly two-minute ad it released Thursday in the state 	1	1	1
Romney has made four trips to the state  while Obama has been here three times  including during the Democratic Party's convention in Charlotte earlier this month 	1	1	1
But their running mates and wives have been frequent visitors 	1	1	1
Officer fired after posting about Swinney ticket	1	1	2
PICKENS  S C  (AP) — A South Carolina police officer who issued a speeding ticket to Clemson football coach Dabo Swinney was fired after using company equipment to post an account of it on the Internet 	1	1	2

Oil's slide continues  with crude near $92	1	2	1
It was down $3 30  or 3 5 percent 	1	1	1
Several things were pushing prices down 	1	1	1
Analysts said traders are taking profits after oil got above $100 per barrel on Friday for the first time since May 	1	2	1
And there have more signs this week that the global economy is slowing down  which tends to push oil prices lower because people and businesses use less energy 	1	2	2
Also  crude inventories rose three times more than analysts had expected last week 	1	2	1
Crude supplies grew by 8 5 million barrels to 367 6 million barrels 	1	2	1
That's 8 4 percent higher than at the same time last year  according to the Energy Information Administration's weekly report 	1	2	1
Oil has fallen about 7 percent this week 	1	2	1
Oil's decline came despite some news that might have pushed prices higher 	1	2	1
The Bank of Japan said on Wednesday that it would buy more government bonds  which is intended to boost Japan's economy 	1	2	1
And ongoing tensions in the Middle East have tended to drive prices higher 	1	1	2

TOKYO (Reuters) - Three former executives of Japanese camera and endoscope maker Olympus Corp <7733 T> pleaded guilty on Tuesday after being charged in connection with a $1 7 billion accounting cover-up in one of the biggest corporate scandals in Japan 	1	1	3
Prosecutors charged ex-chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa  former executive vice-president Hisashi Mori and former auditor Hideo Yamada with inflating the company's net worth in financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 2007 and 2008  in violation of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law 	1	1	2
As the president of the company I take full responsibility for what happened  he added 	3	2	2
The three former executives had been identified by an investigative panel  commissioned by Olympus  as the main suspects in the fraud seeking to delay the reckoning from risky investments made in the late-1980s bubble economy 	1	1	2
The scandal was exposed last October by chief executive Michael Woodford  who was sacked by the Olympus board after querying dubious deals later found to have been used to conceal the losses 	1	2	2
Woodford campaigned to win his job back  but has given up that bid  blaming cozy ties between management and big Japanese shareholders and citing the strain on his family 	2	2	2
Since then  Olympus has admitted it used improper accounting to conceal massive investment losses under a scheme that began in the 1990s 	1	2	2
The firm is under investigation by law enforcement agencies in Japan  Britain and the United States 	1	1	1
In December it filed five years' worth of corrected financial statements plus overdue first-half results  revealing a $1 1 billion dent in its balance sheet  triggering talk it would need to merge or forge a business tie-up to raise capital 	2	1	2

TBILISI (Reuters) - Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili promised on Wednesday to punish those responsible for torturing and raping prisoners  after video of the abuse was shown on television and sparked protests in the capital Tbilisi 	1	2	4
The prosecutor's office said 10 people had been arrested including the head of the Tbilisi prison  two deputies and a number of guards  The prisons minister said she was resigning 	1	1	4
Tonight  I tell all the victims of these inhuman actions and the whole nation that the Georgia we have built and we are all building together shall not and will not tolerate such behavior - in its prisons or anywhere else  Saakashvili said in a statement issued in the early hours of Wednesday 	2	3	1
Those who committed these crimes will spend long years in jail  as will those who bribed guards to stage these horrors and film them  he said  promising that the rights of prisoners would be better protected 	2	3	3
Georgia  a key transit route for oil and gas supplies across the volatile Caucasus region  is gearing up for an October 1 election in which Saakashvili and his United National Movement face a challenge from a new opposition coalition  Georgian Dream  led by billionaire entrepreneur Bidzina Ivanishvili 	1	2	2
Hundreds of demonstrators rallied overnight in the capital after two pro-opposition television channels  including one owned by Ivanishvili  showed the footage purporting to show torture  rape and other abuses in the Tbilisi prison 	1	1	4
"The protesters  who were urged to join the rally by messages on Facebook  held posters saying ""Rape me!"""	1	1	3
"The government said the videos had been staged and recorded by police officers who had been bribed by ""politically motivated persons"" "	3	1	3
An investigation revealed that several members of the jail's security department had been involved in a plan to carry out abusive activities and record them  the Interior Ministry said in a statement 	1	1	3
Evidence shows that payments were made to coordinate and stage these appalling activities  it said 	1	1	3
Georgian Dream  which unites several opposition parties  has gathered large numbers to its rallies in the Caucasus state  although most opinion polls show it trails the ruling party before the election 	1	2	1
Ivanishvili  56  has a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $6 4 billion  He and other opponents accuse Saakashvili of curbing freedoms and criticise him for leading Georgia into a disastrous war with Russia in August 2008 	1	3	3

BALTIMORE (AP) — The champagne was on ice  plastic shields were in place above the cubicles in the Baltimore clubhouse and couches were removed to accommodate a celebration 15 years in the making 	1	2	1
The party never happened — at least not at the ballpark 	2	1	2
Baltimore clinched its first playoff berth since 1997  but not until late Sunday when the Texas Rangers beat the Los Angeles Angels 8-7 in the finale of a day-night doubleheader 	1	2	1
After the Orioles beat the Boston Red Sox 6-3 earlier Sunday  around two dozen players and coaches took scoreboard watching to a new level by staying on the field at Camden Yards and rooting for the Rangers to win the opener 	1	2	2
Orioles players exchanged high-fives and fist-bumps following their fourth straight win  then gathered along the first-base line to watch the scoreboard telecast of the ninth inning  which began with Texas winning 4-3 	1	2	1
Many in the crowd of 41 257 stood and watched  too 	1	1	1
But a two-run double by Torii Hunter put the Angels in front and ruined the fun 	1	2	2
As the Orioles walked off the field  manager Buck Showalter waved to the crowd and offered a fist-pump of encouragement 	1	2	1
"To be able to celebrate out there with them and take in the moment  it would have been pretty neat """	2	2	1
Baltimore  on the other hand  is looking to go into the postseason as AL East champions 	1	2	1

Who'd have thought the Orioles would be talking about division titles  playoff berths and champagne after 14 consecutive losing seasons and four straight last-place finishes?	2	2	2
The Orioles (92-67) already have 23 more wins than a year ago 	1	2	1
Our goal now is try to figure out a way to play some more baseball games here at Camden  Showalter said 	1	1	1
Hopefully  it's see you later 	2	1	1

Zach Stewart (0-2) gave up five runs and seven hits  including two homers  in 2 2-3 innings 	1	1	2
In three starts this season he's surrendered eight home runs 	1	1	2
A sunny  breezy fall afternoon couldn't have started much better for the Orioles 	2	2	1
After the video board showed the Yankees and Angels losing early  McLouth hit the fourth pitch from Stewart over the left-field wall 	1	2	2
After that just trying to do damage control  Stewart said 	2	1	2
"Try to keep it at that score	2	1	1

OSCE and EU give thumbs-down to Belarus poll	1	1	2
MINSK (Reuters) - International monitors and the European Union on Monday dismissed Belarus's parliamentary election as a sham exercise  increasing the isolation of President Alexander Lukashenko 	2	1	2
"After election officials listed 109 winning candidates for parliament  all from pro-establishment parties  EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton and Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule said the election ""took place against the background of an overall climate of repression and intimidation"" "	2	1	2
Monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said many opposition figures had been blocked from taking part in Sunday's poll 	1	1	2
The rubber-stamp parliament will bolster the power of the authoritarian Lukashenko  who has run the ex-Soviet state since 1994  But the OSCE verdict on the election is sure to increase his international isolation and lock in place poor ties with the West 	2	1	2
The blatant violations in these elections make it clear to everyone that Belarus is the last dictatorship in the heart of Europe  said Guido Westerwelle  foreign minister of Germany  Europe's biggest economy 	2	1	2
Together with our European partners we will increase our efforts to push for the release of political prisoners  to strengthen Belarus civil society and to isolate President Lukashenko and his regime even more 	1	1	2
Lukashenko and his inner circle are under travel and other sanctions from the United States and the European Union 	1	1	2
CRACKDOWN ON PROTEST	1	1	2
Relations with the West nosedived when he cracked down on street protests against his re-election in December 2010  Scores of his opponents were arrested  Many now either lie low after periods in jail or have fled the country 	1	1	2
Western monitoring agencies have not judged an election in the country of 9 5 million free and fair since 1995 	1	2	2
"While not addressing the OSCE verdict directly  Lukashenko said he was always ready to listen to the arguments of Western governments  ""But the main thing that is unacceptable to us is unnecessary 'a priori' pressure """	2	2	2
Belarussian election officials made clear that none of the 109 elected deputies represented any of the few moderate opposition parties that had fielded candidates 	1	1	2
It seems that candidates from the opposition parties do not enjoy the trust of their electorate  Nikolai Lazovik  a senior election official  told a news conference 	2	1	2
The two main opposition parties  United Civic Party and the Belarussian People's Front  had called on people to go mushrooming or fishing rather than vote  in protest at the detention of political prisoners and election fraud  The turnout was officially put at 74 percent 	1	1	2
Human rights bodies say several opposition activists were detained or arrested in the run-up to the poll 	1	1	2
"Lukashenko denounced the boycott call on Sunday  calling the opposition ""cowards who have nothing to say to the people"" "	1	1	2
We were here in 2010 when some of those people were first arrested and put in jail  and we are sad that their voices could not be heard this campaign  Mecacci added 	2	1	2
ONE-SIDED COVERAGE	1	1	2
The OSCE also said the opposition had been severely limited in its access to state-run media  and there had sometimes been a lack of proper ballot-counting procedures 	1	1	2
Coverage of the campaign did not provide a wide range of views  Candidates who called for an election boycott had their free access to media coverage denied or censored  Media coverage focused on the President and government  with minimal attention given to candidates  it said in a statement 	1	1	2
"While early voting and election-day procedures were assessed positively  the process deteriorated considerably during the count 	1	2	2

The election has produced no new personalities to challenge Lukashenko's rule  Previous parliaments have initiated little legislation independently of the presidency 	1	1	2
Despite U S  and EU sanctions  which prevent Lukashenko and his inner circle travelling anywhere in the West  Belarus has weathered a currency crisis that drained it of dollars and caused two big devaluations 	1	1	2
Russia has provided $4 5 billion in loans and investments in exchange for access to industrial assets such as pipelines pumping Russian gas to Europe 	1	2	1

After election officials listed 109 winning candidates for parliament  all from pro-establishment parties  monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said many opposition politicians had been blocked from taking part in Sunday's poll 	3	1	3
This election was not competitive from the start  Matteo Mecacci  an OSCE coordinator  said in the statement 	2	1	3
A free election depends on people being free to speak  organize and run for office  and we didn't see that in this campaign 	3	1	3

Overnight dementia 'camp' allows caregivers rest	1	1	1
"NEW YORK (AP) — Just after 10 p m   when most people their age are going to sleep  a group of elderly folks suffering from dementia are just getting started  dancing and shaking tambourines and maracas in a raucous version of ""La Bamba """	1	1	1
It's a party  says an 81-year-old woman  among dozens of patients brought to a Bronx nursing home every night for a structured series of singalongs  crafts and therapy sessions that lasts until dawn 	2	1	1
It's meant to provide care and activity — lots of activity — to fill the wee hours for people with Alzheimer's and similar diseases who live at home 	2	2	1
And it's meant to provide their caregivers — usually a son or daughter — with a treasured night's sleep 	2	2	1
Without this program  my father would be lost  and I would be crazy  said Robert Garcia  whose 82-year-old father  Felix  is in the program at the Hebrew Home at Riverdale called ElderServe at Night 	3	1	2
"He doesn't sleep	1	1	1
447 overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916 At night he's wide awake  and he needs activity "	1	1	1
"We would all wake up  and my daughter would ask  'Why is Grandpa screaming?	2	1	1
447 overnight-dementia-camp-allows-caregivers-rest-183000916 Why is he so grumpy?'"	2	1	2
Garcia said 	1	1	1
Now he comes home in the morning  shows me his drawings  tells me what they did all night 	2	1	1
"While many nursing homes offer temporary ""respite care"" so caregivers can catch up on sleep or go on vacation  the overnight-only program at the Hebrew Home fills a niche "	2	1	1
But costs are high  and such programs are rare 	2	1	2
An official at the Alzheimer's Association said she knew of no other 	1	1	1
Daniel Reingold  president and CEO of the Hebrew Home  said the nonsectarian overnight program was started in 1998 because anecdotal studies found the biggest reason people gave for admitting loved ones into the nursing home was sleep deprivation of the caregiver 	2	2	2
We heard stories of caregivers who were sleeping on mattresses across the front doorway so their loved one couldn't get out 	2	1	1
Most patients' care is covered by Medicaid  which pays the Hebrew Home $140 a night  plus $74 for transportation to and from home 	1	1	1
"Dr  Robert Abrams  a geriatric psychiatrist at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital  said sleep problems are typical in dementia and include the syndrome known as ""sundowning "" in which the fall of darkness causes confusion and fear "	2	1	1
At the Hebrew Home  shades are kept closed 	1	1	1
"Abrams says an overnight activity program like the Hebrew Home's is preferable to ""fighting nature by insisting that participants try to sleep """	3	2	2
"Ruth Drew  director of family services at the Alzheimer's Association in Chicago  said  ""Many family members want to care for relatives with Alzheimer's at home  but in order to do that  the caregivers themselves have to remain healthy "	2	2	1
Many patients sleep a few hours at home during the day 	1	1	1
As the night passed at the Hebrew Home  other activities were offered to the 34 patients  who were in their 60s to 90s 	1	1	1
During the slow process  the patients were asked  in English and Spanish  about colors and shapes 	1	1	1
Several downed the fruit as it came their way  before salads could be compiled 	1	1	1
"Other nighttime activities include walks through the nearly empty halls of the nursing home and ""movie nights"" with popcorn "	1	1	1
Patients who are up to it are sometimes taken on field trips  for example  to see the neighborhood's Christmas lights 	1	1	1
In quiet rooms  patients with more profound dementia were guided in simple puzzles like putting a peg in a hole 	1	1	1
Others had sand or water poured over their hands to stimulate tactile sensations and perhaps reminiscences 	1	1	1
They haven't been to the beach in years  said program director Deborah Messina 	2	1	1
Maybe it's a fond memory 	2	2	1
On occasion  a patient would nod off 	1	1	1
"There are ""resting rooms"" for patients who want to sleep  but half-hour naps in their chairs are more common "	1	1	1
It's like a sleepover  Messina said 	1	1	1
It's a little bit of a party  and like a sleepover  when they come home in the morning  they haven't slept much 	1	1	1
Pablo Escobar T-shirts a hit in Mexico drug war states	2	1	4
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Nearly two decades after Colombian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar died in a hail of bullets  his eldest son is conquering new markets in Mexico - with a fashion line in his father's image 	2	2	4
The shirts are emblazoned with images of the Medellin cartel boss  who flooded the world with cocaine before he was shot dead in 1993 	2	1	4
Featuring pictures from Escobar's student ID card  driver's license and other images  the shirts cost between $65 and $95 - a small fortune in a country where about half of the population lives in poverty 	3	1	2
We're not trying to make an apology for drug trafficking  to glamorize it in the way that the media does  insists Marroquin  39  who was born Juan Pablo Escobar Henao  but changed his name to avoid reprisals after his father's death 	3	1	3
In a bid to head off criticism that the line glorifies drug crime  the shirts carry messages to provoke reflection 	3	2	2
"One bearing Escobar's student card reads: ""What's your future looking like?"" while a design emblazoned with his driver's license warns: ""Nice pace  but wrong way """	3	2	2
"The cotton shirts  which went on sale last year in Mexico  are selling well in stores in Culiacan  the capital of western Sinaloa state  which is home of Mexico's most wanted trafficker  Sinaloa cartel chief Joaquin ""Shorty"" Guzman "	2	2	4
About 60 000 lives have been lost in the last six years 	2	1	5
I see it as a strong symbolic product  said Vicente Sanchez  a researcher at Mexico's Colegio de la Frontera Norte 	3	1	3
The state     has to have a better grasp of things directed at young people  as that's the way that these anti-values gain ground  he added 	3	1	3
"There are plenty of books on Escobar's exploits and even a Colombian television soap opera  ""Pablo Escobar: The Boss of Evil"" that aired this year "	2	2	2
Those who set out to criticize me are the same who have profited from the story  life and name of Pablo Escobar  Marroquin told Reuters in an interview on Skype 	3	2	2
The 39-year-old has said he held off opening stores in Colombia out of respect for drug trafficking victims there 	2	2	3
Despite the success of the clothing line in Mexico and other markets  Marroquin insists that there has been an enduring downside to his father's legacy that has followed the family in the 19 years since his death 	3	2	3
In 1994  we left Colombia     but because of our surname  we couldn't get a passport anywhere in the world     for the crime of having Escobar DNA  says Marroquin  who lives in Argentina 	4	1	3

Pakistan blocks cell phones on prophet protest day	1	1	1
ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan has blocked cell phone service in major cities to prevent militants from using phones to detonate bombs during a national day of protest against an anti-Islam film produced in the United States 	1	1	2
An Interior Ministry official says the service is blocked in at least 15 cities  including Karachi  Lahore and Islamabad 	1	1	1
The service is scheduled to be resumed at 6 p m  local time 	1	1	1
The government has declared Friday a national holiday and has encouraged people to peacefully protest a film that denigrates Islam's Prophet Muhammad 	1	1	1
The film has sparked violent protests throughout the Muslim world that have left at least 30 people dead  including two in Pakistan 	1	1	3
PESHAWAR  Pakistan (AP) — A bomb targeting a Pakistani military vehicle instead struck a passenger van on Wednesday in a city in the country's northwest  killing at least eight civilians  a police official said 	1	1	4
Tahir Ayub Khan says the afternoon blast on the outskirts of Peshawar wounded another 27 civilians  plus three air force officers in the targeted vehicle 	1	1	3
Khan said the bomb was set off by remote control 	2	1	2
The passenger van and the air force vehicle were driving through the area at the time 	1	1	1
Non one immediately claimed responsibility and Khan says they were still investigating the motive for the attack 	1	1	2
Peshawar is considered the gateway to Pakistan's tribal areas 	2	1	1
Militants fighting the Pakistani government often target security officials in and around the city  although violence has dropped considerably in recent years 	2	2	2
Panthers WR Steve Smith unhappy with QB Cam Newton	1	1	2
"(AP) — Panthers receiver Steve Smith says he"" lit into"" Cam Newton about his actions on the sidelines when the young quarterback was replaced late in the fourth quarter of Thursday night's 36-7 blowout loss to the New York Giants "	2	1	3
Smith says he was upset when Newton remained sitting on the bench instead of watching backup Derek Anderson and trying to learn from his own mistakes 	1	1	2
"Smith says he called Newton out so he could ""understand this is more than about playing football  it's about becoming a man and understanding this is what it's about """	1	2	1
The 23-year-old Newton has taken losses hard in the past and Smith says it's time for the QB to better handle adversity 	1	2	2
Park Service defends refusal to use wolves	1	1	1
BOULDER  Colo 	1	1	1
(AP) — The National Park Service acted properly when it ruled out using wolves to control the elk population in Rocky Mountain National Park  government lawyers argued Thursday before a federal appeals court 	3	1	1
The government also defended the use of trained volunteers to help Park Service employees shoot and kill excess elk  saying it didn't violate a hunting ban in national parks 	2	1	2
In a hearing before the 10th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals  a law student representing the wildlife advocacy group WildEarth Guardians argued the Park Service did not give enough consideration to the wolf option and rejected it without giving the public a chance to comment 	2	1	2
The group also said letting volunteers shoot elk instead of limiting the shooting to Park Service employees was tantamount to hunting 	2	1	2
WildEarth Guardians sued the Park Service in 2008  asking a Denver federal judge to overturn the park's elk-thinning policy 	1	1	2
The judge upheld the policy last year  and WildEarth Guardians appealed to the 10th Circuit 	1	1	1
The appeals court normally meets in Denver but heard this case at the University of Colorado Law School in Boulder as part of an outreach program 	1	1	1
The judges did not say when they would rule 	1	1	1
Rocky Mountain National Park sometimes has so many elk that they overgraze the vegetation  leaving other animals without enough food and habitat 	2	1	1
The park launched a 20-year program in 2008 to thin the herd by having park employees and trained volunteers under park supervision periodically shoot and kill elk 	1	1	2
They cited a lack of support from other agencies  safety concerns of people who live nearby  expected conflicts between wolves and humans and the amount of attention that a wolf population would require of park officials 	2	1	2
The current size of the herd in the park's lower elevations is 600 to 800  which is within the target range set by the program  so no elk were killed last winter 	1	2	1
No decision has been made on whether or how many elk will be killed this coming winter 	1	1	1
Wolves disappeared from much of the West after decades of hunting and government-backed extermination 	1	1	1
They were re-introduced in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming in 1995  and some advocates have argued for bringing them back elsewhere 	1	1	1
Pending home sales dip in August due to supply shortage	1	1	2
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned U S  homes slipped in August due to a shortage of lower priced inventory in most of the country  an industry group said on Thursday 	2	1	2
The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index  based on contracts signed in August  fell 2 6 percent to 99 2  but was 10 7 percent higher than last year 	2	1	2
July's reading was revised up to 101 9  the highest level since April 2010  when buyers were racing to use the home-buyer tax credit before the deadline  the group said 	2	2	1
The performance in month-to-month contract signings has been uneven with ongoing shortages of lower priced inventory in much of the country  the association's chief economist  Lawrence Yun  said in a statement 	3	1	2

Pettitte overcomes rust  quiet stadium in comeback win	4	2	1
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Evergreen New York Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte gave the Bronx Bombers reason to rejoice on Wednesday in his return from a three-month injury absence despite an unfamiliar feel in a pennant race game 	2	2	1
Pitching for the first time since fracturing an ankle on a batted ball on June 27  big-game pitcher Pettitte took the mound before an uncommonly sparse Yankee Stadium crowd of about 15 000 in a rescheduled game to make up for Tuesday night's rainout 	2	1	1
I probably would have liked more of an October feel  the 40-year-old left-hander said after earning the win in a 4-2 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays that nudged the Yankees into first place in the American League East 	2	2	1
"It helps you get into the flow	2	1	1
458 pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb In the beginning of the game  it was almost like you could hear people talking and I'm just trying to focus  you know what I'm saying?	1	1	1
458 pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb So I think for me it would probably have been better if we had a packed house """	2	1	1
Pettitte was not at his sharpest  having to pitch out of first-and-third jams in the second  third and fourth innings  but when he needed to  he was able to coax a ground ball that helped him escape danger 	3	2	2
Yankees manager Joe Girardi was pleased 	3	2	1
"Asked how much Pettitte could help the Yankees  whose 10-game AL East lead in July has evaporated with the charge put on by the red-hot Orioles  Girardi said: ""A lot "	2	2	2
"There's a lot of experience there and he knows how to get it done """	2	2	1
Pettitte  who ended a one-year retirement from the Yankees to come back this season  said he was getting antsy to pitch 	1	1	1
When you see these guys go through what they've been going through and I've been sitting here watching  trying to cheer-lead for them  it's just great to be able to go out there and contribute a little bit  he said 	2	1	1
Any time you win at this time of the year is precious 	2	2	1
Girardi said having Pettitte back was big 	2	2	1
You have confidence in Andy because he knows how to get that double play ball  get that strikeout and make the big pitch  and know he's not going to be overwhelmed by the situation 	2	2	1
Pettitte  who improved to 4-3  threw 75 pitches  right at the limit Girardi had set for him in his return 	1	1	1
He gave up four hits  walked two and struck out three 	1	1	1
"I didn't think my command was as sharp as I would like	2	1	1
458 pettitte-overcomes-rust-quiet-stadium-comeback-win-215657557--mlb But it's obviously a good win and I'll take it  said Pettitte  a perfectionist who has thrived in the postseason and tops Major League Baseball's all-time list with 19 postseason wins "	2	2	1
I'm 100 percent 	2	2	1
Pettitte  winner of five World Series rings with the Yanks  said the team expects the race to go down to the wire 	1	1	1
We know this is going to be a dog fight  added Pettitte  who said the team saw highlights of Tuesday night's 18-inning win by the Orioles over Seattle before Wednesday's game 	2	1	2
Obviously  you'd love to see them lose some games  but we just need to keep winning  keep playing well 	1	1	1
Philippines  Muslim rebels close to peace deal	1	2	1
MANILA  Philippines (AP) — The Philippine government and Muslim rebels resumed talks Tuesday on resolving final differences in a preliminary peace accord they hope to conclude soon  in what is expected to be a major breakthrough toward ending a decades-long rebellion in the country's south 	2	2	1
"Government negotiators met with representatives of the 11 000-strong Moro Islamic Liberation Front in Kuala Lumpur  Malaysia  to attempt to seal what they call a ""framework agreement"" on major issues  including the extent of power  revenues and territory to be granted to a Muslim-administered region "	1	2	1
It would be the most significant progress in years of negotiations on ending a rebellion that has left more than 120 000 people dead and held back development in the south 	2	2	3
Western governments have long been worried that rebel strongholds could become breeding grounds for al-Qaida-affiliated extremists 	3	1	2
"Rebel negotiator Mohagher Iqbal said at the talks' resumption that they are ""now on the home stretch and the smell of success is reinforced every day """	2	2	1
Iqbal warned that if the negotiations are not concluded soon  opponents might endanger a final deal 	3	1	2
The greatest source of risk comes from spoilers  leaders  and parties who believe that these     negotiations threaten their power and interests 	2	1	2
"Government negotiator Marvic Leonen said that ""to state that what we hope to be able to do again in the next few days is historical is definitely an understatement """	3	1	1
We are on the brink of layering the written predicates that can frame the process of building trust as we usher in an era of peace  of hope and of recovery  Leonen said 	3	3	1
It dropped a demand for a separate Muslim state and now seeks an expansion of an existing Muslim autonomous region and more powers and resources to rehabilitate the violent  poverty-wracked area 	2	1	1
The initial accord is to contain general agreements on key issues 	1	1	1
A transition commission would be established to work out the details of the preliminary pact  which would hopefully lead to a final accord in as little as three years  Iqbal has said 	1	2	1
The attacks and an ensuing military offensive killed more than 100 people and displaced about 750 000 villagers before a cease-fire was forged 	1	1	3
Last August  a rebel faction opposed to the talks attacked several army camps and outposts in southern Maguindanao and North Cotabato provinces  sparking two weeks of sporadic fighting that left more than 50 dead and displaced 45 000 others 	1	1	3
The new unrest eased after the military launched a crackdown 	1	2	1
Philippines' Oscar hope is drama on aging gay man	1	1	1
MANILA  Philippines (AP) — An independent drama that explores the loneliness and missed opportunities of an ailing  70-year-old gay man is testing Philippine sensibilities about sexuality and hoping to advance in the Academy Awards' foreign-language film competition next year 	2	2	2
"Bwakaw  or ""Voracious "" has received positive reviews and local awards and is doing the rounds of international film festivals in Toronto  New York  Hawaii and Tokyo "	1	2	1
Writer and director Jun Robles Lana says the movie is named after a stray dog with a voracious appetite for life that has a bond with the main character  Rene  Bwakaw's zest for life contrasts with Rene's grumpy disposition 	1	1	2
Rene came out of the closet in his twilight years  thinks it is too late for love and only awaits his own death  He has made a will and labeled his few possessions to be given away to friends  He even bought a coffin at a funeral home's closing-out sale 	1	1	2
"But when Bwakaw dies after an illness  Rene  played by veteran actor Eddie Garcia  finds new appreciation for life  ""It's the dog that basically teaches him to live life to the fullest "" Lana said in an interview Wednesday "	2	2	1
It's really more about loneliness  although you can't help that some people or critics are branding it a gay film simply because the character is gay  but that's really beside the point  he said 	2	1	2
Lana admits that while Filipinos are generally gay-friendly — the most popular movie star is Vice Ganda  an out-and-out gay comedian — local mainstream audiences might not be too receptive to a serious take on homosexuality in the conservative and predominantly Roman Catholic society 	2	1	2
"We tend to look at gay characters as iconic  funny characters  he said  ""So when you make a movie like this  you really have to market it in such a way that it would be more appealing to them """	2	1	1
He said that the movie focuses on the comedy aspect in order to appeal to a wider audience 	1	2	1
He said he made the film with the intention to honor his mentor  writer Rene Villanueva  who died in 2007  He described Villanueva  who came out as gay later in his life  as generous and harsh at the same time  and an inspiration for the main character  Rene 	1	2	2
"Lana said the drama ""eventually became a story about growing old  missed opportunities  about how desire is inextricable from our lives """	1	1	2
"For Lana  who started in art house films but has for the last few years been mainly involved in commercial movies  ""Bwakaw"" was also ""a return to my roots """	1	1	1
"I did not expect this film which I made for very personal reasons would resonate with so many people and not just Filipinos  he said  ""I'm really just thankful for all the wonderful things going our way """	2	2	1
The Philippines has submitted entries to the Academy Awards for many years but has never been nominated or even short-listed 	1	1	2
Bwakaw is one of around 40 films entered in the foreign-language category this year  The list is to be pared to 10 late this year and to the final five nominees by January 	1	2	1

Plane going to Everest region crashes  killing 19	1	1	3
KATMANDU  Nepal (AP) — A plane carrying trekkers into the Everest region crashed just after takeoff Friday morning in Nepal's capital  killing all 19 people on board  authorities said 	1	1	3
The pilot reported trouble two minutes after takeoff  and Katmandu airport official Ratish Chandra Suman said the plane appeared to have been trying to turn back to the airport 	1	1	2
Suman said he could not confirm if the plane was already on fire before it crashed 	2	1	3

Are the polls rigged against Mitt Romney?	2	1	2
Republican skeptics say the polls are wrong because the people conducting them are interviewing too many Democrats and too few Republicans  exaggerating Obama's support and underestimating Romney's 	3	2	3
Are the major polls skewed against Romney?	2	1	2
Here  a brief guide:	1	1	1
How much of a lead do the polls give Obama?Obama is ahead by six percentage points among registered voters  and by five percentage points among those most likely to show up at the polls  according to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll 	2	1	1
In Ohio  a state that no Republican presidential nominee has won the presidency without  Obama is ahead 53 percent to 43 percent among likely voters  according to a new Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll 	2	1	1
Pro-Romney skeptics say the polls — all of them — are biased in Obama's favor 	3	1	2
What do they think is the problem?The skeptics say that pollsters are choosing their sample sizes based on the assumption that the 2012 turnout will be similar to 2008's  when record numbers of Democratic-leaning Latino  black  and young voters went to the polls 	3	1	2
This year  though  some of those Democrats have grown disillusioned  and Republicans eager to deny Obama a second term are more motivated than they were four years ago  Romney supporters say 	3	1	1
I don't think [the polls] reflect the composition of what 2012 is going to look like  Romney pollster Neil Newhouse says 	3	1	1
"Some polls even forecast a turnout even more favorable to Obama than in 2008  GOP consultant Rick Wilson says in the New York Daily News  ""which even Obama's most dedicated partisans think is highly unlikely """	3	2	2
Why do Republicans think the pollsters are getting it wrong?They say they smell a rat 	3	1	2
The Democrats want to convince [anti-Obama voters] falsely that Romney will lose to discourage them from voting  Republican pollsters John McLaughlin tells National Review 	3	1	3
So they lobby the pollsters to weight their surveys to emulate the 2008 Democrat-heavy models 	3	1	3
One conservative blogger  Dean Chambers  has even created a website called unskewedpolls com	3	1	3
SEE MORE: 3 paths to electoral victory for Mitt Romney	2	2	1
Are the complaints valid?According to pollsters  they're ridiculous 	3	2	1
Party identification  though  is something their polls should measure  not control 	1	2	1
"If pollsters try to even out the numbers artificially  says Doug Schwartz  director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute  ""they are substituting their own judgment as to what the electorate is going to look like "	3	1	3
"It's not scientific """	3	1	3
"So are the polls unfairly skewed against Romney  or not?Look  says Jim Geraghty at National Review  ""a split of D+7 or more is excessive """	3	1	3
Pollsters say their critics are underestimating the weight of minorities in the electorate 	3	2	2
"Not only that  says Steve Benen at MSNBC  but the notion that pollsters — ""literally  all of them"" — would be ""deliberately publishing bogus poll results is pretty silly """	3	3	2
Silly  but predictable  says Doug Mataconis at Outside the Beltway 	3	2	2
The 'biased polling' argument is just a sub-set of the 'biased media' argument conservatives have flogged for decades 	3	2	2
You can bet that if Team Romney's internal polls were better  they'd be leaking them 	2	1	1
They're not  because polling is a science  and the trend is clear 	2	1	1
"If you deny it    well  ""That's not skepticism  that's partisan spin """	3	2	2

This might have been his best performance yet 	2	2	1
In Presidential Decathlon  Obama is Winning	3	2	1
Presidential campaigns aren't decided on the last day of a race 	2	1	1
They are decided in all the days and moments leading up to Election Day 	2	1	1
They turn toward the candidate who puts together a lead going into the final voting in November  and who won or lost the important moments along the way 	1	1	1
In that way  this race in its final months is like a decathlon 	2	1	1
Instead of individual sporting events  it is the combination of 10 moments that determines which candidate has the most points on Nov  6 	2	1	1
Thus far  I would suggest there are have been five moments of significance 	3	1	1
President Obama has either won or tied in each of these  allowing him to build up a small but significant lead 	2	2	1
Polls  when considered as a group  speak to this lead  revealing a race that right now is trending overall (and in all important states) as somewhere between a 1-point and 6-point Obama advantage 	2	2	1
Nearly every poll falls within this range 	1	1	1
I have listened to many Republicans try to point to one poll as indicative of the race and ignore all the other data available 	2	1	2
It happens all the time - in politics  and in life 	3	1	1
They'll need to abandon that tendency if they aim to win any of the important moments coming up in the next seven weeks 	3	1	1
Let's look at five moments already conducted  then the five moments still on the horizon 	1	1	1
So far  Romney basically tied in his best event  which was picking a vice-presidential nominee - Paul Ryan 	3	1	2
He spent 10 days talking about something other than the economy and ended up with little to no bump 	3	1	2
His next best event was the Republican convention  and at best you can say he tied this 	3	1	2
The biggest take away was from a fading actor  Clint Eastwood  talking to an empty chair 	3	2	2
The next event on the calendar was the Democratic convention  and President Obama won this going away  and ended up getting a pretty good bounce from it 	3	2	1
Though the bounce didn't completely last  it did settle into a pretty important 3-point lead 	3	2	1
First was the Libyan tragedy and violence 	1	1	4
In this case  the public judged Obama to have handled the crisis calmly and effectively while Mitt Romney's precipitous statements were viewed by many voters negatively 	2	2	2
Another unpredictable moment came with the release and coverage of a tape of Romney at a fundraiser in which the candidate talked disapprovingly of 47 percent of the country - an unforced error but a Romney loss in this event 	2	1	2
So we are left with five events to come that include three presidential debates in October  one vice-presidential debate  and an unpredictable moment 	1	1	1
In order for Romney and his campaign to get back in this race and have a chance on Election Day  they are going to have to win convincingly at least three of these remaining five moments 	2	1	1
And with voting already beginning early in many states  Romney is probably going to need to do very well in that first debate in Denver 	2	1	1
The only way the Romney campaign can achieve all this is by accepting reality for what it is  not convincing itself anymore that everything is fine 	2	1	1
His team must make a real change in the relationship they have with the voters they need to win in this election 	2	1	1
And like in life  the first sign of self-respect is taking real accountability for how they got in this mess and accepting the hard truth of what they need to do to succeed 	3	2	2
Let's see if they have hit rock bottom and can turn things around for the five events left 	3	1	1
Private Space Travel Gets a Big Boost in California	1	2	1
As NASA's space shuttle Endeavour orbiter flew to its retirement home in sunny California today (Sept 	1	1	1
21)  Gov  Edmund G  Brown Jr  signed legislation to bolster the commercial spaceflight sector in that state 	1	2	1
“California aerospace pioneers like Virgin Galactic  SpaceX and the Spaceship Company are blazing a path to the stars with commercial space travel ” Brown said in a statement 	3	2	1
“This bill allows commercial space-travel companies to innovate and explore without the worry of excessive liability ”	1	2	2
A summary overview of Assembly Bill 2243 shows that it provides qualified immunity from liability to a spaceflight entity for injuries to a space flight participant  so long as a written warning statement is provided to the participant and the injury was not the result of spaceflight entity's gross negligence or intentional acts 	1	2	2
[Now Boarding: The Top 10 Private Spaceships]	1	1	1
The bill requires a spaceflight entity to have each participant sign a “prescribed warning statement” acknowledging that the participant understands the “inherent risks associated with space flight activity  including death  and also acknowledging that the space flight entity has limited liability for injuries or damages sustained by a participant as a result of these inherent risks ”	1	1	3
High desert	1	1	1
Leading the measure that was targeted to an emerging industry in California was Assemblyman Steve Knight (R-Palmdale) 	1	1	1
Knight also said in a statement that  until recently  human space travel was accomplished through government space agencies  with volunteer participants assuming liability for injury and damage 	1	1	2
Assembly Bill 2243 provides limited liability for commercial space ventures to ensure innovators remain competitive in this promising marketplace 	1	2	1
“California  and specifically the High Desert  has a long tradition of pioneering aviation for a century  and human spaceflight since the Apollo era  and was the site of the first private human space flight event  which resulted in the winning of the Ansari X Prize in Mojave  California  in 2004 ” Knight said 	1	2	1
Over the past few decades  Knight added  California has lost a significant slice of its human spaceflight industry development to other states  specifying Alabama  Colorado  Florida  New Mexico and Texas 	2	1	2
The human spaceflight business in California  he said  continues to struggle due to the poor business climate in general  and the current litigious environment 	1	1	2
“The history of space flight and California are inseparable ” Knight said 	1	1	1
“Providing the commercial space industry with a competitive advantage will ensure our state maintains and possibly gains jobs in this important market ”	2	2	1
“This legislation will ensure that California continues to be a place that looks forward … and not back ” Branson said 	2	2	1

If I produced election night coverage	1	1	1
This is an assignment memorandum for the producers of election night coverage 	1	1	1
I feel I am modestly qualified to make these assignments because of my past experience covering politics at the network level  and because this year  I might well be — for the first time — a viewer 	3	1	1
The great gadgets and graphics and gimmicks are fun to watch 	3	1	1
But there are a couple of dynamic data points that everyone who has followed the race closely and those who are just tuning it for the drama will want to know 	2	1	1
Will Republicans take control of the Senate?	1	1	1
Will they hang on to the House?	1	1	1
If I were producing the coverage  I'd make sure that  at all times in the lower third of the screen space  we'd have a graphic showing the current and projected advantage for Republicans in the House and Democrats in the Senate 	3	1	1
That is  let's say that it's 9:00 p m  ET  and based on the races that have been called and projected so far  Democrats are clinging to a one-seat Senate majority 	2	1	1
Right now  Democrats have a four-seat edge (two independents caucusing as Democrats  the vice presidential tie breaker  and 51 seats to their name) 	1	1	1
So the two data points that could be useful right at that moment would show the current composition (53) and the projected composition (51) 	2	1	1
But the more accurate graphic would show how many seats Republicans need to win to flip the chamber 	2	1	1
And that's four  not three 	1	1	1
So producers: Your graphic should look something like this 	3	1	1
It should be on screen at all times  or rotated with the House control graphic  which I'll describe next 	3	1	1
Republicans control 242 seats and Democrats control 193 	1	1	1
But this tells the casual viewer very little 	2	1	1
Republicans have a 25-seat advantage in the House 	1	1	1
So the House graphic would read:	2	1	1
The font would be slightly different for the projected make-up  and it would attest to its dynamic status 	2	1	1
Since polls in Hawaii and Alaska don't close until very late  networks have to use projections 	3	1	1
What makes the second part of the graphic interesting is that it can be updated in real-time to reflect House projections and real-vote returns that come in 	2	2	1
(All networks use essentially the same computer back-end to crunch the numbers  their projection models differ slightly based on the political scientists and analysts who serve on the decision desks )	1	1	1
As the PROJECTED number is updated  it can flash — and anchors/reporters can explain (briefly) why the projection has changed  and perhaps the races that have been called can also flash on the screen 	1	1	1
The graphic does not perfectly correspond to the 435 individual House elections because some can't be called even though the winner might be obvious 	1	1	1
But the computer models will take the safe seats into account and the human modelers will make responsible projections 	1	1	1
Now  to the presidency 	1	1	1
One is to simply show the projected electoral votes for each candidate in real-time 	1	1	1
CURRENT EV (269 NOT CALLED)	1	1	1
ROMNEY + 145	1	1	1
OBAMA + 124	1	1	1
Another would show how many EVs are needed 	1	1	1
TO WIN (300 of 538 NOT CALLED)	1	1	1
ROMNEY needs 100	1	1	1
OBAMA needs 29	1	1	1
Another rotating graphic could show SCENARIOS to victory 	3	1	1
ROMNEY'S PATH NOW: WINNING OH  CO  NV  AND NM	1	1	1
OBAMA'S PATH NOW: WINNING CO AND NV  OR IA AND NV	1	1	1
But here's where networks can get creative 	1	1	1
"So Ohio looks good for Romney  based on the turnout models that we have """	2	2	1
On screen  you'd see:	1	1	1
OHIO (18 EVs)	1	1	1
ROMNEY: 378 304 — 48 percent	1	1	1
Margin: 14 000	1	1	1
At this point  John King  Chuck Todd  and their maps can go to town 	2	1	1
But rarely do networks actually quantify the projected outstanding vote in states  and I don't know why 	3	1	2
They have the data (I've seen it)  and it anchors the drama of the night in reality 	2	1	1
The exit poll data and the real-vote tracking ability of the networks is truly awesome on election night  and for the sake of viewers  I think it ought to be incorporated into the graphical crawls more easily 	3	1	1
Technically  there are no impediments 	2	1	1
Proof that Star Trek's warp drive might actually work?	3	1	1
And now a NASA scientist  Harold White  says he has created a feasible model for warp drive  building on a theory expounded by Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994 	1	1	1
Here  a guide to these far-out findings:	2	1	1
What's the history of this warp-drive theory?	1	1	1
Alcubierre was the first scientist to come up with a model for warp drive 	1	1	1
Imagine a football-shaped spacecraft attached to a ring that would constantly encircle it 	2	1	1
By creating one of these warp bubbles  the spaceship's engine will compress the space ahead and expand the space behind  moving it to another place without actually moving  says Jesus Diaz at Gizmodo 	1	1	1
The problem?	1	1	1
"The energy needed to warp space equals ""the mass-energy of Jupiter "" says Shane McGlaun at TechnaBob "	1	1	1
Okay 	1	1	1
So what has this NASA scientist discovered?	1	1	1
"In addition  White says ""the intensity of the space warps can be oscillated over time "" further reducing the energy required  says Clara Moskowitz at Space com "	1	2	1
"With these adjustments  White says his warp drive can be powered with a ""mass about the size of a spacecraft like the Voyager 1 probe NASA launched in 1977 """	1	1	1
All in all  his warp drive model would move objects at 10 times the speed of light 	2	3	1
How is he testing his theory?	1	1	1
White and his colleagues have begun experimenting with a mini-version of the warp drive in their laboratory  says Moskowitz 	1	1	1
"They are using a ""laser interferometer"" to make miniscule versions of space-time warps  in what White has described as a ""tabletop experiment """	3	1	1
Is warp drive really necessary?	1	1	1
"Yes! ""With our current propulsion technologies  interstellar flight is impossible "" says Diaz "	1	1	1
Protests threaten Georgian leader's grip on power	1	1	2
TBILISI (Reuters) - Nana Dumbadze was all set to vote for Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili's party in an election next week  That is  until she saw television footage of prisoners being raped 	1	1	3
The 37-year-old teacher was so shocked that she has decided to switch allegiance from the leader of the Rose Revolution that swept out the ex-Soviet old guard in 2003 to an opposition bloc  Georgian Dream  led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili 	2	1	2
The prison brutality scandal  which has ignited protests  has left Saakashvili's United National Movement (UNM) facing an unexpectedly tough battle to keep power in the volatile Caucasus state  a transit route for oil and gas to the West 	1	1	2
It has raised the stakes for Saakashvili  He has promised to leave the presidency next year and needs a UNM victory in the October 1 parliamentary election to keep a hand on Georgia's reins and avoid the risk of political oblivion 	1	1	2
The parliament will have stronger powers after next year's presidential election and Saakashvili could steer an ally into the post of prime minister with enhanced authority or take the job himself  though he is not expected to do that 	2	1	1
"I'd intended to vote for Saakashvili's party but after watching what we've all seen on TV I've changed my mind and will vote for the opposition now  Dumbadze said  ""I think it's immoral to vote for this government """	2	1	2
Dumbadze described asking her mother to make sure her two sons  aged seven and 10  do not see the footage on television while she is away at work or on errands 	1	1	1
The scandal has dimmed the image the pro-Western  U S -educated Saakashvili cultivated as a reformer who has curbed corruption and ushered in democracy  handing ammunition to foes who say he has actually trampled on rights and freedoms 	2	1	3
"The grim footage has enabled Ivanishvili  a once-reclusive tycoon who has a spectacular glass and steel house overlooking Tbilisi  to call the vote ""a choice between good and evil"" "	2	2	2
Saakashvili  44  became the West's political darling when he rose to power after the bloodless revolution that toppled Eduard Shevardnadze  a former Soviet foreign minister 	2	2	1
The abuse scandal has increased tensions before the vote  prompting calls for restraint from the West 	1	1	2
"The opposition says 60 supporters have been detained by police  describing an ""atmosphere of fear and intimidation""  The ruling party says supporters have been attacked by protesters and urged the six-party Georgian Dream to reject violence "	1	1	2
But Saaskashvili has also promised to clean up the jails  His interior and prisons ministers have resigned  The Tbilisi prison chief  two deputies and several guards have been arrested 	1	1	2
I think they did quite well in reacting  said Thomas de Waal  a Caucasus expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington  Whether it will be enough for Saakashvili's party to hold onto power is less clear 	2	2	1
FADED ROSE?	1	1	1
An opinion poll in August put UNM on 37 percent support against 12 percent for Georgian Dream and showed 43 percent of respondents could vote either way  No polls have appeared since the protests but the opposition is expected to make gains 	1	1	2
I think that these events will have a huge impact on the election and will overshadow the nihilism  illusions and the government's propaganda  said Shorena Shaverdashvili  editor-in-chief of the independent Liberal magazine 	2	1	2
"De Waal said the abuse scandal would ""help support the opposition narrative in Georgia that the government has built a facade which hides unpleasant realities and has failed to improve the lives of ordinary people """	2	1	2
But the opposition is still less well mobilized and hasn't been able to articulate very well what it is offering instead and the electoral system also favors the ruling party  so I still expect the UNM to win more seats on October 1  he added 	1	1	2
Narmania is unemployed and her husband is bedridden by a wound from the 1992-1993 war in which the Black Sea region of Abkhazia broke from Tbilisi's control 	1	1	2
Georgia's economy  hit by the war and the global financial crisis  has been growing again since 2010  But inflation was 11 2 percent that year and the government expects a rate of 6-7 percent this year after a dip to 2 percent in 2011 	2	1	2
Saakashvili was hailed by the West as a shining example for his promise to clean up the corruption  rigged elections and economic stagnation that blighted Georgia's first decade of independence after the Soviet Union collapsed 	1	2	2
His team restored 24-hour electricity and clamped down on police bribe-taking  and the economy took off before the war and crisis  But critics accuse him of curbing democracy  persecuting opponents  pressuring courts and controlling the media 	1	2	2
The war with Russia put Abkhazia and the rebel region of South Ossetia  both now recognized by Moscow as independent nations  further from Georgia's reach  Russian leaders depict Saakashvili as a hothead itching to take the regions by force 	1	1	2
"Saakashvili  for his part  says President Vladimir Putin wants to gain sway over a country that was under Russian or Soviet control for almost two centuries  He has called the abuse scandal ""Russian mud"" financed with ""Russian money"" "	1	1	2
Those who thought that they could carry out Putin's orders in our country will be very disappointed  Saakashvili told supporters on Sunday in Zugdidi in western Georgia 	2	1	2
Psychopaths Have Poor Sense of Smell  Study Finds	1	1	2
New research suggests we may be able to sniff out psychopaths by their poor scores on a smell test 	2	2	2
In the study  psychologists at Macquarie University in Australia tested the noses of more than 70 college-age participants  all without criminal records 	1	1	1
The researchers reported a correlation between a poorer sense of smell and psychopathic personality traits 	1	2	2
They say this makes sense because previous research has shown that people with such traits have decreased function in the brain's frontal lobes  a region associated with impulse control and acting in accordance with social norms — and dysfunction in that part of the brain is associated with an impaired sense of smell 	1	1	1
When speaking of their crimes  psychopaths use less emotion and focus more on their basic needs than non-psychopaths  that research found 	1	1	2
Psychopaths  believed to make up as much as 1 percent of the general population  may attempt to fake answers during psychological evaluations  so a measure of smelling ability could offer a helpful new way to detect psychopathic traits  the researchers said 	2	2	2
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that any attempt to unilaterally use force or interfere with events in the Middle East or North Africa would be counter-productive  rebutting growing calls to intervene in Syria's civil war 	2	1	2
Both countries have also voiced opposition to new sanctions on Iran and to any moves to attack it 	2	1	2
Attempts to replace the universal principles of the U N  Charter by unilateral actions or partisan deals  moreover to use force bypassing the U N  do not do any good  as is well known  Putin told foreign ambassadors in the Kremlin  where he was receiving their new credentials 	1	1	2
"Putin said his warning concerned civil unrest in the Middle East and North Africa  adding that the U N  Charter was meant to be used to solve problems ""through negotiations  without external interference"" "	1	2	2
"Incitement of violence in different forms in order to change the regime only pushes the situation into a dead end	1	1	3
475 putin-speaks-against-unilateral-intervention-133808421 Violence creates violence  Putin said "	1	1	3
The 18-month-old revolt  which began as peaceful street protests  has escalated into a civil war in which activists say over 27 000 people have died 	1	2	4
Russia accused NATO of overstepping a U N  Security Council mandate for a no fly zone over Libya last year to help rebels overthrow former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 	2	1	2
Earlier this month  Putin condemned the attack that killed the U S  ambassador to Libya but made it clear he believed Western support for rebels in Arab countries was fuelling chaos 	2	1	3
Russia has also accused Western nations of encouraging Syrian rebels including armed extremists 	2	1	2

FORT WORTH  Texas (AP) — RadioShack says CEO James Gooch has agreed to step down immediately and is leaving its board of directors 	1	1	2
The struggling consumer electronics company has begun a search for a replacement 	1	1	2
RadioShack says Chief Financial Officer Dorvin Lively will serve as interim CEO 	1	1	1
RadioShack Corp  says it is in the process of hiring an executive search firm to help find a new CEO and that it may consider both internal and external candidates 	2	1	1
Gooch had become CEO on May 2011 	1	1	1
RadioShack  which is based in Fort Worth  Texas  has about 4 700 company-run stores in the U S  and Mexico 	1	1	1
It has approximately 1 500 U S  wireless phone centers and about 1 100 dealer and other outlets worldwide 	1	1	1
Radvanovsky takes on Donizetti queen	1	2	1
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Early in the second act of Donizetti's opera ""Anna Bolena "" the heroine confronts her lady-in-waiting Jane Seymour  who confesses that she will soon replace her as the wife of Henry VIII "	2	2	1
It's one of the great scenes in bel canto opera 	2	3	1
And as performed by soprano Sondra Radvanovsky and mezzo-soprano Sonia Ganassi at the Washington National Opera on Tuesday night  it exploded off the stage and sent sparks flying into the auditorium at the Kennedy Center 	4	4	1
Part of the problem was the visually imposing but heavy-handed staging by Stephen Lawless  part of it the limp conducting by Antonello Allemandi 	2	2	1
This prodigiously gifted American soprano remains something of a work in progress 	2	3	2
There was a lot to like in her first crack at this touchstone role  which the legendary Maria Callas restored to the modern repertory in 1957 	2	2	1
The basic quality of Radvanovsky's voice can be thrilling — a penetrating sound that is hard-edged without being harsh 	3	3	1
She unleashed astonishing power  especially at the top of her range (though she was not always able to scale back the volume when she should have) 	3	2	1
But there were still traces of her tendency to sing flat  and some of her phrasing was rhythmically imprecise 	2	2	2
Dramatically  she has not yet found the emotional depth to portray the tragic queen as much more than the weepy victim of a conniving king 	3	1	2
The one exception came in the encounter with Ganassi  when the Italian mezzo's own intensity seemed to jump-start her performance 	3	3	1
Throughout the night  Ganassi used her ample  plummy voice to create an impassioned portrayal of a woman torn between her love for Henry and her pity for Anna 	3	3	1
American bass Owen Gradus made a handsome  swaggering Henry  binge-eating and drinking as he engineered the trap that would rid him of his unwanted wife 	3	2	2
He sang energetically  though his voice is a size too small for the role 	3	2	2
Georgian tenor Shalva Mukeria displayed a pleasant  slightly nasal sound and nailed his many high notes as Anna's beloved Percy 	3	2	1
Scenery is wheeled in or lowered from the flies 	1	1	1
But Lawless has a way of belaboring the obvious  including his overuse of Anna's daughter  the young girl who would become Queen Elizabeth — and figure prominently in two subsequent Donizetti operas 	2	1	2
The real Elizabeth was not yet 3 when Anna died and has no role in the opera as written 	2	2	2
In a program note  Lawless speculates this may be why Elizabeth never married!	2	2	2
And it was a mistake to drop a large grill with prison bars during Anna's final scene  obscuring our view of her just when we should be focusing our eyes on nothing else 	2	1	2

LONDON (Reuters) - The credit rating firm DBRS is in no rush to change its Spanish rating despite the country's worsening economy because stabilization measures such as the European Central Bank's new bond-buying program could start at any point 	2	2	3
Markets' eyes are currently trained on Moody's to see whether it strips Spain of its investment grade status as Madrid struggles with cash-strapped regions  an ailing bank system and rising debt refinancing costs 	2	1	3
It delayed the decision on Tuesday to give itself until the end of the month  but some analysts believe a downgrade from Baa3 could help push Madrid to take EU aid 	3	2	3
Despite that focus  a DBRS downgrade would do more real damage because unless they could find alternative assets  it would cut the amount of ECB money Spanish banks would be able to borrow 	2	1	3
Fergus McCormick  head of sovereign ratings for DBRS  said the fact European help was waiting in the wings would spare Spain from any knee-jerk rating changes 	3	2	2
In the context of a weak economic environment  an unclear policy response from Europe  and popular discontent in Spain  the higher deficits are worrying and place further downward pressure on our A (low) rating  which has a Negative trend  McCormick told Reuters 	3	1	3
"And yet  we are not going to jump to conclusions	2	2	2
480 rating-firm-dbrs-wont-rush-conclusions-spain-154357205--business Because the backstop could come into play and stabilize bond markets  providing Spain time to reduce its deficit more gradually and implement tough structural reforms "	2	2	2
"We have no doubt that Europe has the ammunition to stabilize the situation	3	3	2

Ravens seek redemption against Brady's Patriots	2	2	1
(Reuters) - The Baltimore Ravens will be looking to avenge a heartbreaking loss that cost them a trip to the Super Bowl last season when they host the New England Patriots in primetime on Sunday for Week Three's marquee showdown 	2	2	2
A missed 32-yard field goal from then Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff that likely would have sent the AFC Championship into overtime is the lasting memory of the Patriots' 23-20 win but the pain was particularly acute for some Baltimore veterans 	2	2	3
Ed Reed  one of the finest free safeties of the past decade  considered retirement after the bitter disappointment of that January loss but decided to return for one more shot at a Super Bowl championship ring 	3	1	3
On Sunday he comes face to face with the Patriots again but insists the defeat is no longer on his mind 	2	2	3
"That was last year	3	1	1
481 ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl They only crowned one champ last year  if I'm not mistaken	3	1	1
481 ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl It's behind us  Reed  34  told reporters "	3	2	1
"We're a totally different team this year	3	2	1

481 ravens-seek-redemption-against-bradys-patriots-173754607--nfl It was over and done with after that game "	2	2	2
The changes to the Ravens roster have been matched by some alterations in style with quarterback Joe Flacco making more use of the no-huddle offense but it remains the defense  with Reed and fellow veteran Ray Lewis  that is the defining aspect of the Baltimore team 	2	2	1

The Patriots have managed to do that pretty well against Baltimore - their only loss in seven meetings came in the 2009 season's wild card round  with Reed one of three Ravens to intercept Brady 	2	2	1

Rays eliminated despite 5-3 win over Orioles	3	1	2
I'll find out tomorrow morning  said Maddon  who then was asked if he expected to sleep well 	3	2	1
Bad news awaited the manager when he woke up Tuesday — his team was eliminated from postseason contention 	3	1	3
That stretch kept them in contention for the AL's second wild-card until Oakland beat Texas 4-3 later Monday night 	3	2	2
We've played 12 playoff games and we've won 11 of them  said Maddon  whose team has outscored opponents 80-31 during the surge 	4	3	1

Real 'Jersey Boy' Frankie Valli to play Broadway	1	1	1
"There will be the fake one taking the stage of the August Wilson Theatre for the Tony-winning ""Jersey Boys "" and the real one appearing for seven nights at the Broadway Theater with The Four Seasons beginning Oct  19 "	1	1	1
"The 78-year old Valli has been belting iconic hits like ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You "" and ""Sherry"" with his trademark falsetto for years  Recently  the New Jersey native spoke to The Associated Press about his career  a stint on ""The Sopranos"" and where to get the best corned beef sandwich in New York "	2	2	2
AP: What's special about playing Broadway this fall?	1	1	1
Valli: I can't think of anybody who had a play on Broadway about their life and appeared on Broadway at the same time  so it was something that I was trying to get happening for a couple years and unable to get anybody to really understand what I was talking about 	1	1	2
AP: Since recording technology was far less sophisticated when you started out  how important was it to emotionally deliver the song in the studio?	1	1	2
Valli: The first and most important part about having a hit record is something that I learned a long  long time ago  You needed to have a hit song in order to have a hit record  If you didn't have a hit song it didn't matter how great the performance was or the arrangement or the production — you didn't have a hit record  That's just the way it was  It didn't matter if your name was Frank Sinatra or James Brown  It just didn't matter  Every artist has misses  You hopefully go into the studio and do music that your audience is going to like but that does mean they're gonna like everything that you make and sometimes you can run out of ideas 	2	2	3
AP: How did The Four Seasons approach it?	1	1	1
Valli: I always looked at The Four Seasons as being more of an innovative group for the kind of music that they did  We really never followed what was happening on the radio  We weren't listening to what was happening on the radio  We went in and made music that we loved to do  We had fun doing it  I think when you start to sit down and try to figure out what is it that makes the hit is when you begin to have trouble 	2	4	2
AP: What was it about The Four Seasons and that era?	1	1	1
Valli: It was a very strange phenomenon because we were a guy's group and girls liked what we did  but in a lot of cases there were groups that guys didn't like because they felt they were being threatened  We were not that  We were saying a lot of things that these street guys wanted to say 	1	3	2
AP: When did you realize you wanted to be a recording artist?	1	1	1
"Valli: I first started out in this business not really wanting to be a pop singer  I was more interested in jazz  That's what I wanted to do  And I remember as a kid  I would sit in the kitchen on the floor — we lived in the projects — with the door open to the outside and I'd listen to ""Symphony"" Sid  which was on the radio from 12 at night until 6 in the morning  My father would go bananas so I had to keep it so low "	3	1	3
AP: What led you to your trademark falsetto vocals?	1	1	1
Valli: A lot of groups did  They just used falsetto a little differently than they did  We used it as a lead-in  We used it much stronger  Everybody else used it as background  In a lot of cases we used it as background  too  I sang lead and then when we were making the record I sang a high background part with it 	1	1	1
AP: At what point did you know you were onto something?	1	1	1
Valli: To be perfectly honest with you  at first when I decided to do pop music I wasn't overly excited  you know? I was trying to do this jazz thing  Jazz wasn't really happening to any great degree  Listening to the radio one day I said  'Hell  I can do this too '	2	2	2
AP: What would we be surprised to learn that you listen to?	1	1	1
Valli: I like country music  I like jazz  and I like blues  (Bob) Dylan is probably one of my all-time favorite  favorite people that there is  Probably America's greatest poet  I've always seen him as that  As (Bruce) Springsteen is the other side of Dylan  Dylan brings out everything that's wrong in the world and Springsteen he finds things that are good 	4	3	2
"AP: What was it like playing Rusty Millio on the ""Sopranos""?"	1	1	1
Valli: I loved it  It's a part of my life that was really a part of my life  although I was never mobbed up  I grew up in New Jersey  I lived in a neighborhood where there was a presence of organized crime    but all the clubs and bars that everybody worked in were owned by these guys  So I got to know everybody 	1	4	3
AP: What did you have for lunch?	1	1	1
Valli: We went for a corned beef sandwich on Houston Street — Katz Deli  The secret isn't in not how much meat it is  I don't know if you noticed but they cut it with a knife  It doesn't cut on a machine because it just crumbles  There are no places that do it like that anymore  They undercook it in most places  because they get more sandwiches out of it  You overcook it  and it shrinks  But that's the only way it tastes just right 	2	2	3
Reality TV: The Invisible Front in Hollywood's Labor Wars	3	1	3
LOS ANGELES (TheWrap com) - Reality TV is the invisible front in Hollywood's labor wars 	3	1	3
Though reality TV workers once made it as far as the bargaining table  most are as far as ever from winning union representation 	1	2	3
But the issue was knocked out at the finish line in the guild's last contract negotiations with the studios and networks  Meanwhile improved work conditions  a fragmented  freelance work force and pressures of a weak economy have set those efforts back considerably since 2009 	3	1	3
"WGAW's Director of Communications Neal Sacharow  insists the fight isn't over yet  ""We want writers in reality TV who want to organize their production companies or shows to know that the WGAW is ready and available to work with them to get Guild representation "" he told TheWrap "	3	3	1
But since Verrone was defeated by Christopher Keyser in his bid for re-election last year  the WGAW's efforts have taken on a much lower profile and their tactics have changed dramatically 	2	1	3
Other obstacles remain in the path of unionization 	1	1	2
Bartsch remembers taking part in the WGA-sponsored effort in 2009 to organize reality editors and story producers but said that things have changed  He noted that certain reality production companies in Hollywood - once known as the worst offenders in treating their employees - have improved working conditions  making organizing more difficult than it already had been 	3	2	4
Then there's the problem of determining what is out there to organize 	1	1	2
There is no umbrella group for the production companies  Many production firms are put together for a specific project  the way a TV movie or indie film is  The projects can be one-offs  planned for single season or simply canceled quickly  Neither the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers nor the Motion Picture Association of America maintains overall data on the sector 	1	1	1
In the second quarter of this year  reality TV projects accounted for 1 461 permitted production days  That dwarfed the permitted days for dramas (581)  sitcoms (274) and pilots (253)  	2	1	2
"The economy doesn't help  either  particularly here in California where so many productions have left the state """	1	1	3
Many of the shows that do stay are extremely low-budget  which is a big part of their appeal to the networks  And there is a sense among producers  and even some cast and crew members  that unionization is not the best business model 	1	2	3
Other elements of reality TV production make it a challenge to organize workers 	1	1	2
Employees tend to move from one project to another and often switch companies at the same time  And the workers are often young people anxious to gain a foothold in show business and unconcerned with either health or retirement benefits 	1	1	3
"It's hard to organize in reality because you have so much freelance employment  Lowell Petersen  executive director of the WGA East told TheWrap  ""You don't have traditional setups like nurses in the hospital or factory workers on an assembly line  It's project by project """	1	1	2
"The WGA East scored a landmark victory in July  winning company-paid health benefits  paid time off and compensation minimums for roughly 30 reality writer-producers via deals with Lion Television (""Cash Cab"") and Optomen Productions (""Worst Cooks in America"")  The deals  which took nearly three years and numerous filings with the National Labor Relations Board to achieve  were the guild's first reality pacts in the region  There is less reality production in New York  and it much of it tends toward documentary-type fare  as opposed to on the West Coast "	1	3	2
"In August  IATSE's Local 700 won company-paid health and retirement benefits for 11 crew members on the Burbank-based Mission Control Media-produced Syfy show ""Hot Set"" after shutting down production "	1	3	2
But those triumphs have been hard to come by and relatively rare  and no one disputes that the majority of reality workers remain non-union 	1	2	2
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters and International Alliance of Stage Employees have quietly stepped into the vacuum left by the Writer's Guild West  They are favoring a stealthier  bottom-up approach 	1	2	1
"Dayan of the Teamsters said his union takes a similar tack for the sake of the employees  ""They don't want to be seen talking with you because they don't want to be fired "" he told TheWrap  ""I think of us like the police and fire departments - it takes the citizenry to call first """	1	2	2
The unions' motivation isn't entirely altruistic  The difficult economic times and the degree to which the networks have replaced scripted fare with cheaper unscripted shows have taken a toll on some of the unions' dues base and health and pension funds in particular 	2	2	3
"For us  safety issues are critical  said Dayan  who represents drivers  ""There are federal and state laws that apply when you're transporting employees in terms of drug testing and proper rest  We have to convince the employers that using union drivers is not only the safe way and the right thing to do  but it is cost-effective """	2	3	2
Dayan remains optimistic  but said he wished that the Teamsters and other unions had been more aggressive when reality TV production began exploding in about 2000 	2	2	3
"I would absolutely say there is momentum to organize within the reality sector  Dayan said  ""Our relationship with the IA has definitely paid off  and we're making inroads  It's slow  but it's sure """	3	3	2
Rebel Wilson proves you can eat dessert every day in Hollywood	1	1	1
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Playing a character called Fat Amy is probably not the dream of most Hollywood actresses but Australian comedienne Rebel Wilson enjoys breaking the rules - and she's not about to stop eating dessert 	2	3	3
"After several small but memorable roles in films such as ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Bachelorette "" the 27-year-old Wilson looks poised to make it big in the musical film ""Pitch Perfect "" which opens in U S  movie theaters on Friday "	2	3	1
But it is Wilson who steals the show with wild antics and improvised one-liners as singer Fat Amy  a cardio-averse  over-confident member of acapella group The Bellas 	3	3	1
"Variety's review said the ""picture belongs to Wilson "" adding that the actress ""fearlessly steps into yet another part that pokes fun at her figure  and happily reveals an outsized singing voice and hilarious dance moves to match """	4	4	1
"Boxoffice Magazine wrote that Fat Amy ""is the role that will turn her into a star "" pointing out that Wilson is ""hilariously  thrillingly crude"" and ""could very easily gobble up the film if she weren't such a generous ensemble performer """	4	4	1
Wilson has no qualms about making fun of her own figure 	1	2	1
"In comedy  you've got to use what you've got  Wilson told Reuters  ""I'm not a size two  so of course I'm going to use that physicality to my advantage """	1	2	1
Weight maybe be a factor in her newfound Hollywood career but she is conscious about staying healthy 	1	2	1
"You need to have a lot of stamina to do this (job ) she points out  ""I try to be healthy  I train three days a week with a trainer  But I do like to eat  clearly  And I do eat dessert every day  If I cut that out  yes  I would lose weight """	1	2	1
Guess what I wear in the movie? Victoria's Secret underwear - that's all I'm dressed in  said Wilson 	1	1	1
I know I'm not the physical body type that he usually casts  but for some reason he likes me and thinks I'm funny  so maybe I'm changing his mind  she said of the director 	1	3	2
Wilson's physical stature was never something she thought would be a factor when it came to her career because she did not set out to be an actress 	1	1	1
"She graduated from the University of New South Wales with a law degree and was a Rotary International youth ambassador for Australia  stationed in South Africa  While there  she contracted malaria  an event she called ""life-changing """	1	1	3
When I was in the hospital in intensive care  I had this hallucination that I was an actress and that I was really  really good  and that I won an Oscar  Wilson recalled 	1	3	3
"She decided to make a career change  Unable to find acting work or an agent  she wrote and starred in her own play  ""The Westie Monologues "" which became a huge success in Sydney "	1	4	1
"That really set the bar high  Wilson admitted  ""I got a lot of movies off the back of that """	1	3	2
"She'll soon be getting more exposure in the TV comedy ""Super Fun Night "" which was picked up by ABC this month  In yet another sign that she's not just another Hollywood actress  she wrote the script for herself to star in "	2	3	1
CHICAGO (AP) — The Cincinnati Reds became the first team in the majors to clinch a playoff spot this season  beating the Chicago Cubs 5-3 Thursday while manager Dusty Baker remained in a hospital after being diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat 	3	2	2
Ace Johnny Cueto and the NL Central leaders ensured themselves of at least a wild-card spot 	2	2	1
He left Wrigley Field before Wednesday night's game and underwent another test Thursday 	1	1	1
Baker is hoping to return to Cincinnati on Friday 	1	1	1
Bench coach Chris Speier ran the team for a second straight game 	1	1	1
Cueto (18-9) pitched six shutout innings as the Red completed a three-game sweep 	2	2	1
The Reds broke a scoreless tie by getting five straight singles off reliever Manuel Corpas (0-2) in the seventh during a five-run rally capped by Henry Rodriguez's two-run double 	2	3	1
Cueto gave up five hits with four walks and broke a three-game losing streak 	3	2	2
The Cubs scored in the seventh on Anthony Rizzo's RBI single and in the eighth on Welington Castillo's fifth homer again 	1	1	1
Rizzo had an RBI grounder in the ninth against Alfredo Simon  who pitched the final 1 1-3 innings for his first save in as many chances 	2	2	1
Baker did some of his best managing to pull them through 	2	2	1
His first challenge was cobbling together a bullpen after closer Ryan Madson tore an elbow ligament in spring training  ending his season 	1	1	2
Setup men Nick Masset and Bill Bray also got hurt before the season opened 	1	1	2
Baker eased Aroldis Chapman into the closer's role  and the hard-throwing left-hander set a franchise record with 27 consecutive saves 	1	2	1
Baker also had to juggle his batting order and lineup after Votto tore knee cartilage and was sidelined on July 16 	1	1	2
There was some good fortune  too 	2	3	1
All five starters have made it through the season without injury  a franchise record 	3	2	1
The Reds had to use a sixth starter only because of a doubleheader 	2	1	1
NOTES: Cueto's two strikeouts gave him a career-best 159 	1	2	1
    Reds 2B Rodriguez and CF Denis Phipps made their first career starts and SS Didi Gregorius started for just the fourth time 	1	2	1

Remarkable rookie Colsaerts saves Europe from a shutout	3	3	2
MEDINAH  Illinois (Reuters) - Ryder Cup rookie Nicolas Colsaerts single-handedly saved Europe from being shut out in Friday afternoon's fourballs with a sensational round in what amounted to a duel with Tiger Woods 	3	3	2
Colsaerts  the first Belgian to play in the Ryder Cup  got little help from his playing partner Lee Westwood but still carried the team to a one-up win over Woods and Steve Stricker  making eight birdies and an eagle 	1	3	2
I've dreamt about this  Colsaerts told reporters 	3	2	1

Westwood said he felt like a spectator with the best seat in the house as he watched his partner roll in a series of monster putts 	3	3	1
I didn't really have a lot to do  the Englishman said 	2	2	1
"He brought me in to read a putt on 15 and I panicked	3	1	3
488 remarkable-rookie-colsaerts-saves-europe-shutout-004553957--golf I wondered why he was even asking me because everything he looked at went in "	3	2	1
"It was an amazing  amazing round of golf """	3	3	1
Colsaerts  the longest driver among the 24 players on the Ryder Cup rosters  was steady off the tee but sizzling hot with his putter  draining half a dozen birdie bombs of 20 feet and longer to hold off Woods 	3	2	1
Woods  who also lost his morning foursomes match  posted seven birdies in the afternoon  including five over the last nine as he carried the fight to Colsaerts 	1	2	2
Europe assistant captain Paul McGinley said the point earned by Colsaerts was vital for the team after they ended the day 5-3 behind 	3	3	2
It was psychologically massive that we won that game and didn't get a whitewash  said McGinley 	3	3	2
All credit to him  it was brilliant 	3	3	1
Colsaerts had five birdies on the front nine then an eagle-three at the par-five 10th by draining a five-footer 	1	2	1
It was a remarkable performance for a player who had fallen so far off form that he lost his European Tour card  then his regular status on the Challenge Tour 	3	3	3
When you look back and see where I was three years ago I'm just the perfect example that if you want something really bad and put your work into it  if you've got the heart and the passion  anything is achievable  Colsaerts said this week 	4	4	2
"It's almost like I feel I've come back from the dead  which is a bit of a weapon	4	4	2

Report: Ohio nurse didn't realize she took kidney	1	1	1
"COLUMBUS  Ohio (AP) — A nurse who accidentally disposed of a living donor's kidney during a transplant said she didn't realize it was in chilled  protective slush that she removed from an operating room  took down a hall to a dirty utility room and ""flushed down a hopper "" according to a report released by health officials on Monday "	2	1	1
The nurse said she had been on a break when a surgeon told everyone the kidney had been put in the sterile  semi-frozen solution 	2	1	1
That detail was in a review by the state for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and obtained by The Associated Press through a records request 	1	1	1
Hospital administrative staff members interviewed on Aug  21 hadn't determined how the nurse took the 13-gallon bag of slush  meant to extend the kidney's viability  past several members of the medical staff without them noticing a problem  the report said 	2	1	1
It said poor oversight and communication and insufficient policies were factors in the kidney's disposal  which prompted the voluntary  temporary suspension of the hospital's living-donor kidney transplant program and led to reviews by health officials and a consulting surgeon hired by the hospital 	2	1	2
"The hospital  in northwest Ohio about 135 miles north of Columbus  ""failed to provide adequate supervision and communication resulting in a donor's kidney being carried out of the operating room  down a hall  into a dirty utility room  and flushed down a hopper "" the report stated "	2	1	2
The hospital has since enacted clearer policies to clarify communication between nurses who fill in for one another and to make sure nothing is removed from an operating room until the patient has been moved from it  the report said 	1	1	1
The surveyors determined the hospital wasn't in compliance with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  or CMS  conditions of participation for transplant and surgical services 	2	1	2
CMS will authorize a full review of the conditions of participation for the hospital  and  if it's found out of compliance  it could be terminated from the Medicare program  CMS spokeswoman Elizabeth Surgener said in an email 	1	1	2
A spokesman said he had no comment to provide from the hospital Monday 	2	1	1
The hospital hasn't said what happened to the intended kidney recipient  who was supposed to receive an organ donated by her brother 	1	1	1
The intended recipient and her brother were released from the hospital  which didn't identify them and said it couldn't say whether she received a different kidney 	1	1	1
Hospital officials apologized and hired a Texas surgeon to evaluate their transplant procedures but have not released the results of that evaluation 	1	1	1
The hospital also notified 975 patients and potential organ donors and recipients that they might need to make other arrangements for services typically provided through the program under review 	1	1	1
Republican study warns against bailout of state pensions	1	1	1
(Reuters) - State and local governments facing pension liabilities that already total in the trillions of dollar will be forced to seek bailouts from the U S  government  Republican Party Congressional staffers said in a study released on Wednesday  as they warned that such bailouts could have dire consequences 	2	1	2
Republican staff of the U S  Congress Joint Economic Committee said with state debt topping $4 trillion  including $2 8 trillion in unfunded pension benefits and at least $627 billion for retiree health care  states may buckle under the pressure to raise taxes  cut spending and take other measures to pay off their debt 	3	1	2
Despite the massive federal debt and fiscal imbalances  it will be hard for Washington policy makers to deny sympathetic retired teachers  police and firefighters after a previous Congress bailed out Wall Street and U S  automakers  the Republican staff commentary said 	3	1	2
But it warned that any federal bailout would test the political fabric of the nation  citing the tensions in the European Union over the Greek bailout as a similar situation 	2	1	2
In a federal bailout  taxpayers in U S  states now keeping up with their pension liabilities would be paying for states with the worst-funded public retirement systems  the study said 	2	1	2
Because of the difficulties faced in reforming public pension systems -- including union opposition to any reduction in pension and other benefits and the protections provided by law and even by state constitutions -- the study said that a different approach should be taken 	2	1	2
It also suggested that the ability of states to issue tax-free bonds could be revoked if their pension funds are expected to go broke within 10 years 	2	1	2
As undesirable as a federal bailout of state pensions is  setting forth the terms and conditions of a potential bailout may be exactly what is needed to prevent one from happening  the study said 	2	1	2
If the states understand how severe the terms of a federal bailout would be  they are more likely to take action now to fix their unsustainable pensions 	3	1	2
"A wickedly dark comic streak breaks up the vivid violence and relentless bleakness of ""Dredd 3D """	1	2	1
Karl Urban stars as the stoic Judge Dredd  the baddest bad-ass of them all in a dystopian future where enforcers like him serve as judge  jury and executioner  right on the spot  Dredd is the most fearsome of the judges in the squalid  densely populated Mega City One  with his ever-present helmet and a low  monotone grumble that recalls both Christian Bale's Batman and Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name  He acts entirely with his mouth and his sheer intimidating presence  He gets no poignant origin story 	2	2	1
"Dredd and Anderson respond to a gory triple homicide at the Peach Trees housing complex  a 200-story ghetto tower ruled from on high by the ruthless prostitute-turned-drug-lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey  her beautiful features disfigured by a severe facial scar)  When the judges take one of her lieutenants into custody as a suspect (Wood Harris  best known as Avon Barksdale from ""The Wire"")  Ma-Ma puts the whole place on lockdown and insists she'll keep it that way until someone shoots the judges dead "	1	1	2
"Many of the residents are happy to do her bidding because a) they're deathly afraid of her and b) she's got them hooked on a powerful drug called Slo-Mo  which reduces the sensation of reality to 1 percent of its usual speed  These moments make ""Dredd 3D"" stand out visually from so many other movies  whether they're action flicks or drug films  Oversaturated and finely detailed  the Slo-Mo sequences are mesmerizing for their richly colored and radiantly sparkling beauty — and again  Travis doesn't overdo them  which is key "	1	4	1
Review: Great cast saves 'An Enemy of the People'	3	2	1
"NEW YORK (AP) — You almost have to admire the devilishly intricate dilemma Henrik Ibsen creates for his hero in ""An Enemy of the People """	1	2	1
It's diabolical 	4	1	2
Minute by minute  the pressure piles on the shoulders of Dr  Thomas Stockmann  a rather vain scientist who has discovered that the spa town of his birth is built on toxic water 	1	1	2
Yet this well-intentioned whistleblower is put in an untenable spot  and eventually branded an enemy of the people 	3	2	2
A fine Manhattan Theatre Club's production that opened Thursday at the Samuel J  Friedman Theatre starts shakily but ends as a full-throated defense of the individual 	3	1	2
Boyd Gaines and Richard Thomas are marvelous as the battling brothers at the heart of the play  but there are terrific turns also by Gerry Bamman  Michael Siberry and Kathleen McNenny 	4	3	1
Director Doug Hughes paces it like a thriller  with the heat rising steadily 	4	2	1
In his egotistical and naive way  Stockmann expects a parade in his honor when he finds proof that the baths in his 19th century Norwegian town are a health threat 	4	1	2
But the town depends on the tourists who flock to the baths and the mayor  who happens to be Stockmann's brother  is nonplussed by the science 	1	1	1
At first  Stockmann gets the support of the press — represented by journalist Hovstad (a complicated John Procaccino) — and the mainstream townsfolk — represented by a prominent citizen and printer Aslaksen (Bamman) 	1	2	1
They want to use the issue to attack the town leaders 	1	1	2
But that plan disappears as soon as the mayor points out the economic disaster that closing the baths would entail 	1	1	2
Public opinion  so fickle  has shifted  but Stockmann can't back down or compromise 	2	1	2
I want to be able to look my sons in the eye when they grow up into free men  he says 	1	1	1
McNenny  as Stockmann's wife (and Gaines' real-life wife)  is fierce in a part that burns bright but for too short a time 	4	2	2
I have truth and honor on my side  says Stockmann 	1	2	1
What good are they when you have no power?	1	1	1
By now the townspeople have become a mob and that has given Hughes an opportunity to make his staging spill into the audience 	4	2	2
For Stockmann's courtroom-like defense of the exceptional individual over the ordinary throng  Hughes has gotten five actors to occupy the theater's first row and cheer and boo 	1	1	1
One is drunk 	1	1	1
Democracy  Ibsen is saying  is a foul-mouthed mob 	1	1	2
The web of pressure relentlessly closes on Stockmann 	4	1	2
His brother never relents: Blood  of course  proves less thick than sludge 	1	1	1
No matter  says Stockman  who keeps his sense of humor even as he fights to keep honest 	1	2	2
They tore my best trousers  he says 	1	1	2
The first lesson of freedom fighting  never wear your favorite trousers when you go out to fight for truth and justice 	1	1	1
The production benefits from John Lee Beatty's spare  unfussy sets and Catherine Zuber's striking costumes  particularly the black leather trench worn by Hovstad 	4	1	2
The palette here is plenty of grays  darks and muted colors — perfect for a grim look at morality 	4	2	1
Other than the acting  there's little subtlety in this play  which often feels more like a lecture 	5	2	1
Environmentalists will find a warning about global warming and libertarians may pull out an articulate defense of individualism 	2	1	2
But theater-goers without a political agenda get to watch a bunch of actors at the top of their game 	5	2	1
The strongest man  says Stockmann at the rather overwrought conclusion 	1	1	1
He's always alone 	1	1	1
Not to be rude  but this great cast proves the opposite 	4	1	2
NEW YORK (AP) — I grew up in a TV Guide household 	1	1	1
I'd flip through the magazine each week to see what was on 	1	1	1
Keeping track of what to watch was pretty simple with only three main networks and a new one called Fox 	2	1	1
Cable channels showed mostly reruns and old movies 	2	1	1
Add to that all the content available through streaming  downloads and DVDs  and it can be challenging not to miss your favorite shows 	1	1	2
TV Guide's printed edition doesn't bother with full listings anymore 	2	1	2
That's where the new TV Guide app comes in 	1	1	1
You can view listings by time or channel or search for specific shows 	2	1	1
You can create a Watchlist of your favorite shows  movies  actors and sports teams and see what's available on demand now or on television later 	2	2	1
The new app is more comprehensive than the guide on a digital-video recorder because it includes shows available on such services as Hulu  iTunes and Netflix  plus on-demand offerings through Xfinity for Comcast subscribers 	1	2	1
You start by creating an account and picking your television provider from a list 	2	1	1
"The listings are then customized according to what's available on your cable or satellite lineup (there's an ""antenna"" option on the list  too) "	2	1	1
You then start browsing the listings 	2	1	1
"If you see that ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" is on at 5 p m  on Channel 6  you can set a reminder for the iPad (or iPhone) to notify you five  10  30 or 60 minutes before the show starts "	2	1	1
You can have the iPad do that for all episodes or just new ones —or just that particular showing 	2	1	1
"By hitting ""I'll Watch "" you can make that known on a social network such as Facebook or Twitter "	2	1	1
Or you can add the show to your Watchlist 	2	1	1
The Watchlist is the best part of the new app 	2	2	1
I can set it up for quick access to Mets games listings or anything on television starring Natalie Portman 	2	1	1
That's also where you can find out whether any of your favorites are available on DVD through Netflix 	2	2	1
It doesn't tell you about online streaming choices on Netflix (that's coming)  but it does for Hulu  HBO  Cinemax  the CW  ABC  ABC Family and Sony's online streaming service  Crackle 	2	2	2
Others are expected soon 	2	2	1
The Watchlist also shows the episodes you can buy and download from Apple's iTunes store 	2	1	1
"On my Watchlist  I saw that a handful of ""Revenge"" episodes were available for free on ABC "	2	2	1
Clicking on one took me right to ABC's app for viewing 	2	1	1
Through another tab  called New Tonight  you can see which of your favorites are on television that night 	2	1	1
"You can see what's popular based on how many users have clicked ""I'll Watch """	2	1	1
With that feature  I learned of a show about a food truck competition on the Food Network 	2	1	1
There were also special features  such as the fall television schedule at a glance and the Emmy nominees in key categories 	1	1	1
Unfortunately  the app was stingy when it came to giving me information on shows 	1	1	2
"I clicked on ""666 Park Avenue "" hoping to get a description of the new ABC show "	2	1	1
All I got was an option to add it to my Watchlist 	2	1	2
And that show about the food trucks?	2	1	1
I had to go to the TV Guide website on a computer to find out more 	2	1	2
As for the main listings  clicking on any program gets you a brief description  the kind you get in newspaper television guides or old printed editions of TV Guide magazine 	2	1	1
You can add it to your Watchlist  request an alert or post it on a social network 	2	1	1
That's it 	1	1	1
One feature TV Guide might consider adding: The ability to click on a link to get all the other episodes of that show  including those on streaming or DVDs  as well as the other times that particular episode would be repeated on TV 	2	1	1
I'd also like to see a list of each show's key actors in the episode description  along with links to find out what other shows they appear in over the next two weeks 	2	2	1
Those features are available on TV Guide's website  but not on the app 	1	2	2
TV Guide plans to add some of these features to its app at some point 	2	2	1
To get it ready for the fall TV season  TV Guide says it had to focus on the features most requested  the ones most used on its website and those that might help it sell ads 	2	2	2
The TV Guide app beats checking static listings in a newspaper or the TV Guide Network on television 	1	2	1
In many respects  it also beats the TV Guide website  as it doesn't force me to get off my couch to find out what's on 	2	2	1
I can have the iPad right there  next to my remote control 	2	1	1
"The New Tonight section comes closest to offering that  but shows I said ""I'll Watch"" don't appear there  unless I've added them to my Watchlist as well "	2	1	2
Same goes for shows I've requested alerts for 	2	1	2
It's also limited to a few hours that night — not during the day  not the next night  not next weekend 	1	1	2
There also isn't a way to check off episodes I'd already watched  either on television or through streaming 	2	1	2
The TV Guide app is worth checking out  particularly for the way it brings together all aspects of television — the traditional channels  online streaming and episodes on DVDs 	2	2	1
Just don't expect it to take control quite yet 	1	1	2

RG3 leads last-minute drive to beat Bucs 24-22	1	1	1
TAMPA  Fla  (AP) — Billy Cundiff redeemed himself for a poor day kicking  booting a 41-yard field goal with 3 seconds remaining to give the Washington Redskins a 24-22 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday 	2	2	2
Cundiff missed three earlier attempts  including a 31-yarder that wound have put the Redskins (2-2) up by two scores early in the fourth quarter 	1	2	2
He also missed twice in the first half  but was on the money after Robert Griffin III marched his team into position for the winning score 	1	2	2
Tampa Bay (1-3) wiped out an 18-point deficit to go ahead 22-21 on Connor Barth's third field goal  a 47-yarder with 1:42 remaining 	1	2	1
But Griffin wasn't finished 	1	1	1
He completed three straight passes to move the Redskins from their own 20 to the 41  then ran for 15 yards to the 26 	1	1	1
Two plays  Cundiff kicked the winner 	1	2	1
Rhode Island Assembly continues EDC review	1	1	1
The Joint Committee on Economic Development is scheduled to meet Monday afternoon 	1	1	1
"The committee expects to review a report entitled ""Rebooting the Economic Development System in Rhode Island """	2	1	1
The panel is looking at ways to reform the state's Economic Development Corporation 	1	1	1
The EDC gave Schilling's 38 Studios a $75 million loan guarantee 	1	1	1
The panel has already received a presentation on ways to improve the EDC from the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council 	1	1	1
PROVIDENCE  R I  (AP) — Rhode Island's economic development agency has agreed to help the Port of Providence purchase two barge-based cranes  a key investment officials say will modernize the port's facilities 	1	2	1
The state's Economic Development Corp  approved an agreement Monday night that will match a $10 5 million federal grant for the cranes 	1	1	1
Gov  Lincoln Chafee hailed the state's investment  which he says will lead to expanded operations at Providence's port 	1	1	1
He says the cranes will help increase container ship activity and create more jobs at the city's waterfront 	1	2	1
The Port of Providence is managed by ProvPort  a nonprofit public-private partnership 	1	1	1
RI owner of cussing cockatoo appealing noise fine	2	1	2
WARWICK  R I  (AP) — The owner of a foul-mouthed cockatoo in Rhode Island who was slapped with a $15 fine for violating a noise ordinance is appealing 	2	1	2
The judge said Taylor had broken a local law that prohibits residents from letting their pets habitually howl  bark or make other noise 	1	1	2
Taylor's lawyer says the ordinance is unconstitutional because it gives no parameters for what noise constitutes a violation 	1	1	2
He notes the statute says that if someone is annoyed  it's a public nuisance 	1	1	1
A neighbor accused Taylor's bird of parroting vulgar phrases  cursing and loudly speaking expletives 	1	1	2
The neighbor lives with Taylor's ex-husband 	1	1	1
"Richard Gere: Why My Cheating ""Arbitrage"" Financier Is Like Bill Clinton"	3	1	2
"LOS ANGELES (TheWrap com) - ""Arbitrage "" Nicholas Jarecki's indie drama about a high-powered New York hedge fund mogul (Richard Gere) enduring self-inflicted calamities on both personal and professional levels  opened on Friday and racked up exceptionally good business over its first three days  It grossed more than $2 million on fewer than 200 screens  the best-ever showing for a film that opened in theaters day-and-date with VOD "	3	3	3
It's just a beautifully written script  beautifully structured  And it deals with a world that we all want to know more about  It's so relevant to our happiness  what those fuckers are doing 	4	4	2
And I liked the moral ambiguity of all of the characters  especially the character that I'm playing  The gradations of self-awareness  the empathy or lack of it 	3	3	2
"We're conditioned to want to like the main character in a movie  but in the first few minutes ""Arbitrage"" gives us a laundry list of reasons why we shouldn't like this guy  Was it a challenge as an actor to keep us invested in him despite that?"	2	1	3
I could have made the choice to play this character as more of a Bernie Madoff  or even darker  I mean  a real villain  But that wasn't interesting to me  or to Nick  It was too easy  and if I did that I don't think you'd be invested in him  as you say  Although you don't like what the guy does  you've gotta take the trip with him 	3	1	2
"It's like with Bill Clinton  You know he's got problems  but he's our Clinton  It's like  ""He's so lovable  he's so smart  he's cute  he's boyish     "" It was more important for me to get all the cylinders working on that part  as well as the machinations of what a Machiavellian guy in the financial world is capable of "	4	3	3
So Madoff and Clinton were the touchstones?	2	1	1
At the time we made this  Madoff was the elephant in the room  Since then  some characters have emerged who are more like this guy  Jamie Dimon is much more like this character than Madoff - he's a reputable  charming guy who just lost $9 billion of someone else's money 	3	3	3
And Ted Kennedy  Chappaquiddick  I thought  Wow  this is a really potent combination: power with flaws  big ideas  Really Shakespeare-sized stuff here 	3	3	3
A Shakespearean tragic hero  though  would end up dead  Your guy meets a much more ambiguous fate 	2	2	3
The character has a sense of invulnerability  as do a lot of people in that position  There's a feeling that things can be screwed up  but there's a way out of this 	2	2	2
"Absolutely  They're very confident: ""I can make this work and I'm not going to lose "" I spent time with those guys  and that's very much the mentality I wanted to feel on a visceral level  I see that with politicians  too "	3	3	1
"I remember that I used to do this real cowboy stuff in Nevada  We would move horses from the north pasture  the summer pasture  to the winter pasture and back again  It'd be 10 days  and you'd be out there moving 150 horses  A lot of fun  But you hoped for that moment when one horse would take off  you know? We were all good at what we did  keeping the horses in line and moving along  but we were so happy when one horse said ""fuck it"" and ran  Because everyone could get crazy then: ""Let's go get 'em  boys!"""	3	4	2
I think that's part of the mentality  You never put it on the resume that you had a problem  but it gets your blood up 	3	2	1
Huge  But he knows this world  and he wrote that script  so I knew that he can tell stories  You make a bet 	3	2	1
Did his inexperience show during the shoot?	1	1	1
Sure  He didn't know exactly where to put the camera  he didn't know what lens  but he hired really good people who know how to do that  He didn't know how to talk to actors  because he'd never been through it before  And he couldn't really demonstrate to them  because he's not a good actor 	2	2	3
But he was good at keeping his energy up  and the stress level never buried him  It buries a lot of people 	2	2	2
Will you be campaigning or speaking out?	1	1	1
How Rick Perry's campaign imploded: 4 new revelations	2	1	1
"Some political gaffes are so bad  so disqualifying  that they act like the ""political equivalent of antibiotic-resistant bacteria"" and simply kill a campaign  says Jay Root  a reporter for The Texas Tribune and author of the new e-book Oops! A Diary From the 2012 Campaign Trail  That's exactly the kind of blunder that Texas Gov  Rick Perry  once considered the frontrunner for the GOP nomination  committed on Nov  9  2011  when  during a primary debate  he tried to recall the three cabinet departments he would eliminate if he became president  ""I would do away with the Education  the  uh  Commerce  and  let's see "" Perry said  in the campaign's most agonizing 53 seconds  ""I can't  The third one I can't  Sorry  Oops "" That last word became the epitaph for Perry's doomed bid  How did it happen? Here  four revelations from the vantage point of a reporter covering Perry's campaign:"	2	1	2
"1  Perry got no sleep the night before his ""oops""Root reveals that during the debate debacles  Perry ""was just very sleepy "" says Taylor Berman at Gawker  The candidate  who had undergone back surgery in July 2011  had painful sensations in his leg and foot that were keeping him up at night  As Root puts it  after the surgery sidelined him  he went from being a light sleeper to being an insomniac  and it showed  The morning before one debate the governor told his travel aide: ""I didn't sleep a wink "" A Florida GOP official who met the candidate during one commercial break told reporters she could tell he was in physical distress: ""His hand was so cold  like ice  And he was sweating  I don't know what it was  but something was definitely wrong """	2	1	2
"2  Everyone was shocked by his disastrous debatesDuring one debate  Perry gave ""a rambling  incoherent attack"" in which he tried to accuse Mitt Romney of being a flip-flopper  says Connor Simpson at The Atlantic  Root says an ABC News reporter  Arlette Saenz  turned to him and asked  ""Was he like this in Texas?"" Root  often called on to provide similar perspective  was at a loss  ""Honey  we're in uncharted waters "" he told Saenz  ""Behind the scenes  Perry's team was just as confused as anyone  Their guy was awful  and they knew it """	2	1	2
"3  The belated diagnosis for Perry's fog: Sleep apneaArmchair medical experts chalked up Perry's mental lapses to painkillers prescribed after his back surgery  say Ashley Killough and Kevin Bohn at CNN  but the campaign maintained he had stopped taking them  Advisers called in sleep specialists  who diagnosed sleep apnea  Root says  a disorder affecting one in 10 men  causing ""loud snoring and temporary lapses in breathing that disrupt normal sleep "" Perry's doctors prescribed a breathing machine that pushes a constant flow of air through the breathing passages  which helped  ""Perry  an exercise junkie  soon got back to normal once he was able to work out again "" By then it was too late  Root says  ""The narrative had already been set  He was becoming an afterthought """	2	1	2
"4  Perry was going down in flames — even without ""oops""One thing Root's account makes clear  says Joe Holley at the Houston Chronicle  is that ""even if Perry had slept like a baby for eight hours a night "" he didn't stand a chance of acing a brutal  unforgiving presidential campaign  The ""multitudinous gaffes"" were just the tip of the iceberg  There was also ""infighting and feuding at the top and the candidate's woeful ill-preparedness "" Those factors alone ""would have been enough to doom the campaign "" The historically memorable ""oops"" moment ""was merely the coup de grace """	2	1	2
Ricky Gervais Unleashes App That Adds Voices on Social Media	2	2	1
Gervais on Wednesday launched Just Sayin'  a voice-centric audio app that lets users share any combination of voice  text  photos and video on Facebook and Twitter 	2	2	1
He created the app with voice-technology company CloudTalk -- but just how much sway did Gervais have in how Just Sayin' turned out?	2	2	1
I love Californian techies  but they are so easy to impress  he tells Mashable 	3	3	1
The Just Sayin' app lets you post any combination of audio  text  photos and video as one-to-one  one-to-many or many-to-many conversations 	1	1	1
"The app's co-founder David Hayden thinks adding the human voice to social media is ""the next big thing """	3	3	1
News outlets could use it to broadcast voice interviews  celebrities could use it to interact with fans  politicians could use it for public statements and the average person could use it to simply say anything 	2	3	1
We've seen the resistance to voice slowly crumble  Hayden says  predicting voice will become a mainstream medium online by 2014 	3	3	1
We are just waiting to see what presidential candidate picks this up first 	3	2	1
Musicians and other famous faces tested the app in private beta  including Cavo  Nikki Sixx  Tommy Lee  soccer play Brandi Chastain and 2008 presidential candidate Mick Huckabee 	1	2	1
An Android version will be available later this year 	1	1	1
[Voice communication] will create a different world  Gervais says 	3	3	1

As you play with your tall and shiny new iPhone 5  you might find it challenging to remember a time when cell phones didn't slip right into your back pocket 	3	1	1

Rioting erupts as thousands turn up in Dutch town for party promoted on Facebook	2	1	2
AMSTERDAM - Thousands of revelers descended on a small Dutch town sparking a riot after a party invitation posted on Facebook went viral  authorities said Saturday 	2	1	3
Prosecutor Hessel Schuth said 34 people were arrested were arrested Friday night and in the early hours of Saturday morning and would be prosecuted for public order offences 	1	1	4
Scum ran amok in our town  said Rob Bats  mayor of Haren  185 kilometres (115 miles) north of Amsterdam 	4	1	3
"Bats said an initial analysis showed a core group of rioters ""were very violent and well-prepared and deliberately sought confrontation"" with hundreds of police who had been dispatched to the town amid fears of trouble "	3	1	4
Dutch media reported that the party originally was planned as a small celebration by a 16-year-old girl but her invitation went viral when she posted it on Facebook 	1	2	2
"Some of the people arriving in Haren on Friday wore T-shirts emblazoned with ""Project X Haren "" a reference to the film ""Project X"" that portrayed an out-of-control party "	1	1	2
On Saturday  another Facebook group sprang up called Project Clean-X Haren  urging people to help clear up the debris littering the town's streets 	1	3	2

Romney releases his 2011 tax return: 4 takeaways	1	1	1
Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax return and posted it online Friday  triggering a mad media dash to see what was inside 	2	1	1
Romney and his wife  Ann  paid $1 95 million in taxes on investment income of $13 7 million last year (a significant dip from his 2010 haul of $20 million) 	1	1	1
The GOP presidential nominee made his fortune running private equity firm Bain Capital from 1984 to 1999 (or 2001  depending on whom you ask)  so his earnings now come from money he has invested 	2	1	1
What do the revelations say about Romney and his run for the presidency?	2	1	1
Here  four key takeaways:	1	1	1
Why would he do that?	1	1	1
Because he'd sworn up and down that he never paid less than 13 percent of his income in taxes over the last decade  and if he had deducted every penny he was entitled to last year  he would have had an effective tax rate under 10 percent 	1	1	1
Ha!	1	1	1
He paid too much but he said he didn't!	1	1	1

505 romney-releases-2011-tax-return-4-takeaways-171600320--election Whatever "	1	1	1
For one thing  it's Friday  and it's a Washington tradition to dump news on topics you want hushed up when everyone's thinking about the coming weekend 	3	1	2
"More importantly  Romney's '47 percent' secret-video comments already made him the loser on ""the big political scoreboard"" this week  and ""political strategy 101 dictates that when things are going badly is the best time to dump other bad """	3	1	2
Besides  the first presidential debate is just two weeks away  and the longer he waited the more likely the returns were to become a big topic in his showdown with President Obama 	3	1	1
Now he can move on  and work on turning everyone's attention back to the economy and Obama's handling of it 	2	1	1
3  Romney told the truth  Harry Reid didn'tThroughout the summer-long push to get Romney to release years and years of tax returns  says Michelle Malkin at her blog  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev )	2	2	2
claimed that a number of people had told him that Mitt Romney didn’t pay any taxes for a decade 	3	1	2
Perhaps Harry and his imaginary friends would like to apologize now?	3	1	1
Sorry  folks  no scandal here 	2	2	1

Romney's press conference came after a rough week for the candidate  and is the first sign of an attempt by the candidate to turn around the campaign  which is set to make stops in the battleground states of Colorado  Ohio and Virginia before the week's end 	3	2	2
"Asked by ABC News which issues he specifically thinks the President is trying to ""fool"" voters about or which particularly get to him  Romney rattled off a list: the auto maker bailout  taxes and social issues "	3	1	3
They're not that they particularly get to me  but I think that they're inaccurate  said Romney 	2	1	2
My plan was to rebuild the auto industry and take it through bankruptcy so that could happen  and by the way he doesn't mention he took them through bankruptcy  Romney said 	3	2	3
Romney said Obama accuses him of being in favor of lowering taxes on wealthy people 	3	1	2
No I'm not  Romney said 	1	1	1
"I'm not going to reduce the taxes on the wealthy at all  in fact I want to lower taxes on middle income people	2	2	1

ROMNEY'S FUMBLES	2	1	1
Let me begin with a prediction: Mitt Romney will be the next president of the United States 	4	1	1
Why?	1	1	1
Because I cannot believe the people of the United States will re-elect a sitting president who has spent so much of their money to achieve so little visible result 	4	1	2
The conventional wisdom is that social issues are the problem for the GOP coalition  but the truth is the conservative movement's bigger problem is that Americans are not nearly as libertarian as our party elites 	3	1	2
Hence  the poor analyses of the political problems Romney faces 	3	1	2
The first was his convention speech 	1	1	1
Romney's is the first speech in the history of conventions that mustered approval of less than half of Americans  according to Gallup 	2	1	2
"Just 38 percent called Romney's speech ""good"" or ""excellent""  10 percent said it was terrible "	2	2	2
The rest were simply unmoved  apparently 	2	1	1
Too much bio-fluff  too much blame -- and too little coherent case for how electing Romney president will get the economy moving 	3	1	2
When the most memorable line from a convention speech involves the daily red rose your long-dead mom received from your even-longer-dead dad  you've fumbled it 	4	1	2
The second Romney fumble was his blatantly hair-trigger political reaction to the murder of an American ambassador in Libya 	3	1	3
Romney managed to make the first words out of his mouth as the jihadists attacked and killed a U S  ambassador a criticism of the president of the United States 	3	1	3
Memo to Romney campaign: In the middle of a firefight  Americans want our ammo aimed at the actual enemy  not a circular firefight 	4	1	2
"He should have said  ""My message to these immoral killers is: Americans stand as one against your futile and ugly hate "" and left the critique of foreign policy until after the ambassador's body was buried "	4	1	3
"Memo to Romney campaign: Old people who've worked hard and paid taxes all their lives do not like being lumped with welfare moms as ""moochers """	4	1	2
By doing so  Team Romney exacerbated what appears to be a growing liability on the Medicare issue 	3	1	2
In a New York Times/CBS poll  more than 75 percent of voters favor keeping Medicare the way it is 	1	2	1
A Times poll in the swing states of Florida  Ohio and Wisconsin found that about six in 10 voters say keep Medicare the way it is  and three-quarters of the likely voters in each of these states said Medicare is worth what it costs taxpayers 	1	2	1
We've learned in the last few weeks what we already knew: Romney is a weak candidate 	4	1	2
"But it's not Romney alone: Conservative elites appear unaware of how thin the ice is around making Medicare ""reform"" a top issue "	3	1	2
They are natural GOP voters for traditional values -- unless you appear inordinately eager to reform the most popular social program in America 	3	1	1
If Romney doesn't rise to the top of his game  he may not be president 	3	1	2
It's the fourth quarter  but Romney's fumbles are keeping the game close 	2	1	1
The future of the United States of America is at stake 	3	1	1
Romney's Ties to Netanyahu  and the Politics of Iran	1	1	1
Recently  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared on American TV to state his belief that Iran is six months away from nuclear weapons capability 	3	1	2
Currently  the U S  is focusing on economic sanctions against Iran 	2	1	2
National Journal senior correspondent James Kitfield has written on national security and foreign for more than two decades 	1	1	1
In this week’s magazine  Kitfield writes about Romney’s hard line stance on Iran and disavowal of a two-state solution with Israel 	2	1	2
This position  Kitfield says  breaks with all presidents of recent history  Democrat or Republican 	3	1	1
Then we’ll speak with Barbara Slavin  a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and Washington correspondent for Al-Monitor com  a new website devoted to news from and about the Middle East 	1	1	1
Slavin recently returned from Tehran  the capital of Iran  where she saw the impact of U S  economic sanctions and the state of the Iranian nuclear program 	2	1	2
"Rowling leaves door ajar to return to Potter ""world"""	1	1	1
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Harry's still finished  but don't rule out any return to the Potter world 	1	1	1
Although J K  Rowling's first novel tailored for adults is being released this week  she says her next book will likely be a children's book  and in the future she may pen a story related to the Harry Potter universe 	2	1	1
"I think it very likely that the next thing I publish will be for kids	3	1	1
509 rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362 I have a children's book that I really like  it's for slightly younger children than the Potter books  Rowling told the BBC in a television interview broadcast on Wednesday "	2	2	1
"In one of a handful of appearances to promote ""The Casual Vacancy "" which hits bookstores worldwide on Thursday  Rowling told the BBC: ""Truly  where Harry's story is concerned  I'm done "	2	1	1
Yet the 47-year-old best-selling British author did not rule out a Potter spin-off  while she was adamant it would never be for commercial reasons 	2	1	1
"The seven ""Harry Potter"" books have sold more than 450 million books worldwide "	1	1	1
"But I've got to have a great idea  I don't want to go mechanically into that world and pick up odds and ends and glue them together and say 'Here we go  we can sell this'	3	1	1
509 rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362 It would make a mockery of what those books were to me "	3	1	2
"Were that great idea to come  she said: ""I probably would do it "	2	1	1
I'm very averse to the prequel/sequel idea 	2	1	2

(It) says he's leading a quiet life  and he's earned it 	3	2	1
"I had to write on the run and there were times when it was really tough	3	1	2
509 rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362 And I read them  and I think 'Oh God  maybe I'll go back and do a director's cut "	2	1	1
"I don't know "" she said in BBC interview "	3	1	1
But you know what? she added 	2	1	1
"I'm proud I was writing under the conditions under which I was writing	4	2	1
509 rowling-leaves-door-ajar-return-potter-world-195925362 No one will ever know how tough it was at times "	3	1	2
"In a separate interview with ABC's ""Nightline""  Rowling revealed that she had signs of obsessive-compulsive behavior when she was a teenager  and that one of the characters in ""The Casual Vacancy"" was drawn from her own experiences "	3	1	2
"These are things I know from the inside  she said in the interview  some of which was aired on ""Good Morning America"" on Wednesday "	2	1	1
When I was in my teens  I had issues with OCD     checking things  it's very common  double checking  triple checking  it's an anxiety disorder 	3	1	2

Roy Lee  Warner Bros  and 'Titans' Writer David Leslie Johnson Team for 'Chainmail'	1	1	1
LOS ANGELES (TheWrap com)	1	1	1
"- ""Wrath of the Titans"" writer David Leslie Johnson is joining forces with producers Roy Lee and John Middleton of Vertigo Entertainment and Warner Bros  Pictures on the action-adventure fantasy film  ""Chainmail "" a spokeswoman for the studio told TheWrap on Tuesday "	1	1	1
Johnson wrote the screenplay as part of a blind script-writing deal with Warner Bros  The project is now out to directors 	1	1	1
Vertigo has a three-year first-look deal with the studio 	1	1	1
Jon Berg is overseeing for Warner Bros 	1	1	1
"He is a producer on ""Lego: The Piece of Resistance "" ""Godzilla "" and ""Hidden "" which is wrapping in Vancouver  as well as a remake of the South Korean film ""Old Boy "" which begins filming shortly "	1	1	1
"Vertigo also recently partnered on the film ""The Voices "" a psychological thriller to be directed by Marjane Satrapi (""Persepolis"") "	1	1	1
It was the basis of one of the world's greatest role playing games 	1	1	1
New Rules Could Give Oscar Documentary Field a Different Look This Year	1	1	1
- Submissions for the Academy's Best Documentary Feature award have now closed  and a change in rules means the field of nominees could have a very different look this year	1	1	1
"Bear in mind  it probably won't be different enough to include the year's top-grossing doc  ""2016 Obama's America"" - though it'd be the very definition of irony if that conservative film made the cut  since the new rules that could alter the Oscar doc landscape were spearheaded by Documentary Branch governor and famous liberal Michael Moore "	2	2	2
Under new rules proposed by Moore and passed by the branch and the Board of Governors last year  more members will be eligible to vote for the docs in the nominating process - and when their votes are tallied  it will be done using the preferential system  which often awards love-it-or-hate-it movies rather than the safer consensus favorites that prospered under the old system 	1	2	1
"It could mean that the Academy will find room for more of the pop-culture or social docs that were often overlooked under the old system in favor of straightforward issue-oriented films  movies like ""Searching for Sugar Man "" ""Paul Williams Still Alive "" ""Wish Me Away "" ""Marley "" ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi "" ""The Iran Job"" and ""The Queen of Versailles"" might find it easier to get the needed support than they would have last year "	2	2	1
"It's also hard to imagine that harder-hitting docs that were overlooked in past years - Werner Herzog's ""Into the Abyss"" and Steve James' ""The Interrupters"" among them - wouldn't be able to garner enough support to at least move to the 15-film shortlist under the new system "	3	2	2
"As to whether the new process will help 2012's three top-grossing docs  ""2016 Obama's America "" ""Chimpanzee"" and ""Katy Perry: Part of Me"" - well  that seems far-fetched  new system or not "	2	1	2
"Nature films like ""Chimpanzee"" haven't been a typical part of the lineup for decades  concert films almost never get in  and while the anti-Obama movie has played well to conservative audiences (not exactly the Academy's constituency)  few have accused it of being a quality piece of cinema "	3	2	2
We won't know how it all plays out until January  when the nominations are announced  or November  when the shortlist is revealed 	1	1	1
But while the initial reaction to the new rules was focused on the requirement that qualifying films receive a review in the New York Times or the Los Angeles Times  the controversy over that rule was something of a red herring 	1	2	3
In the long run  opening up the pool of voters and moving to the preferential count will likely have a bigger impact on the films that are nominated 	2	2	1
Here's how the major change works:	1	1	1
In the past  the first round of voting for the doc awards was in the hands of small screening committees 	1	1	1
These groups of volunteers from the branch would received a randomly-selected batch of DVDs  and would give each film a numerical score  the films with the 15 highest scores would move on to a shortlist 	1	1	1
The new system does away with the committees and the scoring system 	2	1	2
Instead  all members of the branch  about 150  will receive screeners of all the eligible films (prepared and sent out at Academy expense)  and will simply vote for their five favorites 	1	1	1
That brings the voting in line with most other Oscar categories - which also means that ballots in the category will be counted using the preferential system  a complicated process that sorts ballots by the film listed first  and then redistributes them round-by-round until only five films remain 	2	1	2
The preferential system places heavy weight on a voter's first choice and makes it far better to be passionately loved by a minority of voters than mildly liked by a majority 	2	1	2
That means the emphasis could shift from the consensus films that prospered under the averaged-score system to more daring and divisive films that can do well under the preferential process 	1	1	1
"As for what films might end up on the shortlist  a few titles stand out: Kirby Dick's devastating rape-in-the-military doc ""The Invisible War "" Lee Hirsch's powerful ""Bully "" Amy Berg's ""West of Memphis"" (which will have to face the hurdle of having a film on the same subject  ""Paradise Lost 3 "" nominated last year)  Alex Gibney's Catholic Church expose ""Mea Maxima Culpa "" David France's AIDS doc ""How to Survive a Plague "" Eugene Jarecki's drug-war doc ""The House We Live In"" and Malik Bendjelloul's tremendously entertaining ""Searching for Sugar Man """	1	1	1
"2012 docs that have grossed more than $1 million at the box office  in addition to ""Sugar Man "" ""Bully "" ""Marley"" and ""Obama's America "" include Lauren Greenfield's keenly-observed tale of excess among the super-rich  ""The Queen of Versailles "" and the Disney nature doc ""Chimpanzee """	2	2	1
"Director Steve James  whose ""Hoop Dreams"" was snubbed two decades ago  leading to a previous overhaul of the doc system  and whose 2011 film ""The Interrupters"" caused an outcry last year when it was left off the shortlist  is back with ""Head Games "" about sports-related concussions "	2	1	2
"Other possibilities include ""Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry "" ""Beauty Is Embarrassing "" ""The Central Park Five "" ""Chasing Ice "" ""Detropia "" ""Escape Fire "" ""Ethel "" ""The Gatekeepers "" ""The Imposter "" ""Last Call at the Oasis "" ""The Law in These Parts "" ""One Day on Earth "" ""The Waiting Room"" and the Keanu Reeves-produced ""Side by Side "" a series of conversations about the future of film in the digital age "	1	1	1
But it's hard to determine which films have qualified  many of the most acclaimed docs have screened on the film-festival circuit  which itself does not give a film the one-week Los Angeles and New York runs required to qualify 	1	1	2
Last year's field consisted of more than 100 documentaries 	1	1	1
This year's  which is expected to be slightly smaller under tightened qualifying rules  will be set by the number of films that submitted their paperwork by the end of the day on Monday  and completed their qualifying runs by the end of the year 	2	1	1
By mid-November  when the shortlist is revealed  we should know if Michael Moore's new rules have changed the look of the Oscar doc landscape 	1	1	1
And Moore should know if by making the process more democratic  he also opened the door for a filmmaker on the opposite side of the political spectrum 	2	2	2
But he's probably not losing any sleep over it 	2	2	2

New SARS-like virus detected in Middle East	1	1	3
British health authorities have alerted the U N  of a new respiratory virus in a severely ill patient from Qatar 	1	1	3
The man was sickened by a coronavirus  which causes most common colds but also causes SARS  or severe acute respiratory syndrome 	1	1	3
In 2003  SARS killed hundreds of people  mostly in Asia  in a short-lived outbreak 	1	1	3
Britain's Health Protection Agency said in a statement late Sunday that the 49-year-old patient had recently traveled to Saudi Arabia 	1	1	1
The U N  health agency says virus samples from the patient were almost identical to those of a 60-year-old Saudi national who died earlier this year 	1	1	3
The World Health Organization says it is trying to determine the public health implications of the two cases but isn't currently recommending travel restrictions 	1	1	1
New SARS-Like Virus Reported in the Middle East	1	1	2
A SARS-related virus has killed one man this year and recently made another ill  prompting the World Health Organization to issue a global alert about the disease 	1	1	3
A 49-year-old man from Qatar is being treated in London for a new coronavirus  and Time reported that earlier this year a patient from Saudi Arabia died of a virus that was extremely similar  Those two cases have scientists wondering if the virus could be spreading in the Middle East 	2	1	2
Coronaviruses affect the upper respiratory tract  and some also take hold in the gastrointestinal tract and the lower respiratory tract  While coronaviruses make up some cases of the common cold  they’re also responsible for more virulent infections such as SARS  or severe acute respiratory syndrome 	1	1	2
A SARS outbreak in 2003 caused 774 deaths and 8 098 cases of illness around the world  WHO reports  which is why the organization is keeping a close eye on this small outbreak 	1	1	3
A UK lab test confirmed that his illness was caused by a new coronavirus  and WHO is collecting more information to see how much of a public health risk the two cases pose  In the meantime  no travel restrictions are recommended  The Hajj pilgrimage  which brings millions to Mecca  is scheduled for late October 	1	1	2
Symptoms of SARS  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  start with a high fever and may advance to headache  body aches and mild respiratory problems  Most cases progress to pneumonia  and there is no vaccine 	1	1	2
The virus spreads due to close human-to-human contact via coughing and sneezing  but also can be picked up from touching a contaminated surface and could be spread through the air 	1	1	2
The Associated Press quoted WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl on the outbreak as saying  “It's still (in the) very early days  At the moment  we have two sporadic cases and there are still a lot of holes to be filled in ”	1	1	1
Michael Osterholm  a flu expert at the University of Minnesota   told AP that it’s important to verify how many mild and severe cases are out there: “We don't know if this is going to turn into another SARS or if it will disappear into nothing ” he said 	1	1	2

Scary Medicare Claims	3	1	2
A new TV ad in Florida harkens back to the notorious “death panel” falsehood 	3	1	2
It wrongly claims Medicare benefits could be “rationed” and seniors denied treatment by the new health care law 	3	1	3
In fact  the law specifically forbids rationing or restriction of benefits 	1	1	1
American Crossroads  a super PAC launched with the help of Karl Rove  adviser to President George W  Bush  attacks Democratic Sen  Bill Nelson in the ad  which features a gloomy gray-colored hospital bed with the word “rationed” in red capital letters resting on top of it 	2	1	2
But the law doesn’t establish any kind of board that would make decisions on what care seniors get as they’re waiting in hospital beds  or anywhere else 	1	1	1
The ad reminds us of long-ago-debunked claims from former Alaska Gov  Sarah Palin  who first claimed the law would establish “death panels” that would decide who gets health care and who doesn’t 	3	1	3
Palin pointed to a provision that said Medicare would pay for voluntary counseling sessions for seniors to discuss end-of-life planning with health care professionals 	1	1	1
She later pointed to the “unelected board” referenced in the American Crossroads ad 	1	1	1
In fact  the IPAB is limited in what it can do to curb the growth of Medicare spending 	1	1	1
It can’t restrict benefits or eligibility  increase premiums or taxes  or “ration” health care  according to the Affordable Care Act 	1	1	1
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  page 490: The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration health care  raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums under section 1818  1818A  or 1839  increase Medicare beneficiary costsharing (including deductibles  coinsurance  and copayments)  or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria 	1	1	1
The Kaiser Family Foundation analysis said that the IPAB would be effectively restricted to finding savings from “Medicare Advantage  the Part D prescription drug program  skilled nursing facility  home health  dialysis  ambulance and ambulatory surgical center services  and durable medical equipment ”	1	1	1
The 15-member IPAB would make recommendations for cutting spending that could only be overridden with a three-fifths majority of both houses of Congress  or Congress could institute its own reductions of an equal amount to what the IPAB puts forth 	1	1	1
So the ad gets a point for correctly saying the board’s recommendations “could go into effect without congressional approval ”	1	1	1
But that’s about the only bit of fact in yet another example of Mediscare in this election cycle 	2	1	1
But as we’ve pointed out many times  the law says the members must include national health care experts  physicians and other health care professionals  economists  and representatives of consumers and seniors 	2	1	1
The ad cites a July 13  2011  article in The Hill newspaper as the source of its “rationed” claim 	1	1	1
But The Hill’s article that day on the IPAB simply says that Republicans were claiming that the board would “ration care ”	2	1	1
The headline: “GOP aims for focused IPAB attack ”	1	1	1
An attack on the health care law wouldn’t be complete without the misleading claim that it’s “cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion ”	3	2	1
That’s a $700 billion reduction in the growth of spending over 10 years  and  if it happens  a necessary step to prolong the solvency of Medicare Part A  which covers payments to hospitals 	2	2	1
The ad wraps up its attack on Nelson by saying he “cast the deciding vote for Obamacare ”	2	1	1
Nelson did vote for the bill — but he wasn’t any more critical to its passage than any other senator 	3	1	1
And this isn’t the first time his vote has been given extra  and unwarranted  significance 	3	1	1
The conservative 60 Plus Association said Nelson cast “a deciding vote” in an ad that was launched in June 	1	1	1
As we said then  it was another Nelson  Sen  Ben Nelson of Nebraska  who was one of the last Democrats to say he’d vote for the bill 	1	1	1
Sen  Bill Nelson has pointed that out on his Facebook page 	1	1	1
Schmidt: Autographs getting way too hard to read	1	1	2
Since when did the signatures of today's celebrity athletes become worse than your local physician's scrawl on a prescription slip?	2	1	3
Anyway  I get 10 signed balls given to me in a box that I bring home  A few weeks later  I'm doing inventory on some items I have gotten for the auction and I open the box of balls and I can't read any of the signatures  I study and study  hoping to see a curve or a clue that would lead me to the name 	1	2	2
I asked my wife if she recognized any  None  I made out Roy Halladay  Jim Thome and Jimmy Rollins  A couple had the number — thank you Chase Utley  Ryan Howard  Cliff Lee and Hunter Pence  That was a great clue  at least for me  but what about the person who buys it at the auction and may not know the numbers?	1	2	2
Signatures became valuable on collectible items back in the 1980s  At least that's my recollection  The autograph itself has been a cherished item for as long as I can remember  I stood next to the players' field entrance at Crosley Field in Cincinnati as a kid in the '60s one night hoping to get Willie Mays  No such luck 	3	3	2
I have signatures I value  not because they are worth money  but because of how they were given to me 	2	3	1
"As a kid  my grandmother was on a plane with Jack Nicklaus  Arnold Palmer and Gary Player  How that happened  I don't know  but she brought me all three of their names on business cards  The first says ""Best Wishes  Gary Player "" The next says ""Good Luck Mike  Jack Nicklaus "" The next is ""To Mike  Best Wishes  Arnold Palmer "" All say ""Sept 11  62 "" which I believe my grandmother wrote in the corner "	1	2	1
I was 12 years old in 1962  I'm looking at these cards now  I know all these men personally  have played golf with them  I know Player's and Nicklaus' kids  I was given the autographs 50 years ago of these famous golfers and I still have them  I can read them  You could read them  That's when an autograph was just that — a memory  an experience  something to look at that reminds you of good times 	1	4	1
I remember signing my first autograph in 1970  It was after the first game of the College World Series with Ohio University  We beat Southern California  and as we were boarding the bus a little kid had a ball and we all signed it  I thought it was the greatest thing  putting my signature on a baseball  The first of a zillion  every one of which can be recognized 	3	3	1
As most all of us who have taken advantage of our signatures having value  I have profited immensely from the memorabilia industry  Quite honestly  it has kept many of us from having to find a job after our careers ended  and for that we are thankful 	3	4	2
My signature's value has never changed over the years  Sure  I know there is a class system in the industry  certain signatures retain value and others don't  In my case  one reason it has retained value is it's neat and you can read it  It is legible  shows respect and looks as though I put some effort into the process of creating a collectible item 	3	3	2
What's the point? The point is this generation and its athletes have allowed the autograph phenomenon to assimilate into a game  of sorts  Who will be where and when  and what scam do seekers need to run to take advantage of the moment? It's a game the fans and players play every day  Collectors using small children and pretty girlfriends to get sellable merchandise  hiding out at various locations with briefcases  planning their attack just to get a scribble 	2	1	3
No longer a handshake  smile and a short conversation and the personalized autograph that seals the memory  Now you get a scribble  And for some reason  fans accept it as normal 	1	2	2
So  I got my dozen balls for the charity auction  I was excited that those guys scribbled for me  but I had to put some sort of sign next to each ball so people would know who signed them 	1	3	1
Am I off base here  thinking that there is some link to one's level of respect for his signature as it relates to his respect for where it might be displayed? Or has the environment hardened the players to the point of not caring either way?	3	2	3
Don't be surprised if the future of those famous athletes' autographs is simply their uniform number  Why not? At least you can read it  And it suffices for proof that the fan and the athlete shared space  Actually  I think a stamp makes more sense  Think about it  conversations aren't part of it  handshakes either  why not a legible stamp? Bop  bop  bop — think how many more can be done in the same time  albeit the value of each one would certainly drop 	1	3	1
Probably too much to ask for a wholesale change in attitude from both sides  As if the players will sign neat and speak to the fans while signing  and fans and collectors will respect the player's right to privacy in certain areas and not stalk them near hotels and airports 	1	3	2
Autograph utopia: Neat signatures  kind words  handshakes  no pushing or shoving  quality opposed to quantity  Any chance?	3	4	2
Me  I just want to know which Phillies signed those balls 	1	1	1
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Health providers should screen all adults and pregnant women for risky drinking habits  a government-backed expert panel said Monday in new draft recommendations 	1	1	2
Researchers found that with such interventions  at least one in every ten risky drinkers can be brought back down to what is considered a safe drinking level 	1	2	1
For men  that means no more than four drinks on any one occasion and at most 14 a week 	1	1	1
For women  the numbers are three and seven  respectively 	1	1	1
The really good interventions incorporate self-help materials  they incorporate an action plan made by the doctor and the patient - they're not just a prescription  said Dr  Daniel Jonas of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  who led the research review but is not part of the USPSTF 	2	1	1
It's estimated that about one in three Americans drink too much 	1	1	2
The new draft recommendations repeat the USPSTF's previous position from 2004  noting that the evidence is still insufficient to give advice regarding adolescents 	1	1	1
They are based on the research update from Jonas and colleagues  which included 23 trials of alcohol counseling  each trial had anywhere from 72 to more than 1 500 people and lasted from six to 48 months 	1	1	1
If the answer is yes  the health provider should gauge the level of misuse 	1	1	1
If it's limited to risky use  not yet causing direct physical or mental harm  then a few counseling sessions with the doctor can be helpful 	1	2	1
He and his colleagues found such interventions cut the average weekly alcohol use by 3 6 drinks on average compared with no intervention 	1	2	1
They also reduced binge drinking by 12 percentage points and risky drinking by 11 percentage points 	1	2	1
That means nine people would need to be counseled for one to cut back to safe drinking levels 	1	2	2
And that might even be an underestimate of the true benefit of counseling  said Jonas 	2	1	1
That's because even people who didn't get counseling had been screened  making them aware they drank too much and possibly leading them to cut back 	2	2	1
Screening and counseling has little potential to do harm  according to the researcher 	1	2	1
"Still  there is no proof that drinking less actually leads to fewer accidents or deaths  which is why the task force gave the recommendation a grade ""B"" instead of a ""A """	1	1	1
"Jonas acknowledged that with about a fifth of Americans being ""risky drinkers "" a universal screening program could be pricey "	2	1	2
While Medicare reimburses doctors for it  it's time out of the calendar for both patients and health providers 	2	1	2
That is really the biggest challenge with implementing this  Jonas said  adding that UNC is in the process of training its doctors to do the screening 	2	1	1
Training is a big piece of it too  because a lot of providers need to learn how to do it  the researcher said 	2	1	1

Sea Creatures in a Warming World: Winners and Losers	1	2	2
MONTEREY  Calif 	1	1	1
— The world's oceans are getting more acidic  a phenomenon predicted to wreak havoc on most sea life 	2	1	2
We know evolution can occur on relatively short ecological timescales  said Gretchen Hofmann  a biologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara  at the Third International Symposium on the Oceans in a High CO2 World meeting last week 	2	1	1
She added that the big remaining question is which species will survive  and which won't be able to cope 	2	1	2
As carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere (as a result of burning fossil fuels)  about a quarter of that atmospheric carbon makes its way into the oceans  where it dissolves and makes the waters more acidic 	1	1	1
Currently  because of this process  the oceans are about 30 percent more acidic than they were at the start of the industrial revolution 	1	1	1
But other ocean-dwellers that rely on protein instead of calcium carbonate to create shells fare better 	1	2	1
For instance  small crablike arthropods about the size of sand fleas actually increase productivity in extremely acidified water  said Kristy Kroeker  a biology doctoral student at Stanford University 	1	2	1
These are rapidly growing  small-bodied creatures with larvae that crawl instead of swim  and they actually do very well  Kroeker told LiveScience 	1	2	1
[Spectacular Photos of Sea Creatures]	2	2	1
Hofmann's lab has found that purple sea urchins are able to cope with highly acidic waters  probably because of the amount of genetic diversity within the species 	2	2	1
The group collected sea urchins from a spot off the Oregon coast that has naturally high acidity from the upwelling of deep ocean water 	1	1	1
In the lab  the researchers compared the genetic data of these urchins when raised at high-acidity and normal-acidity conditions  finding 150 genes turned on that helped the urchins move calcium around their systems 	1	2	1
In addition to urchins  some corals tolerate the changing oceans better than others 	1	2	1
Katharina Fabricius  a coral reef ecologist with the Australian Institute of Marine Science  said that colorful branching coral can't cope with higher temperatures and ocean acidity  but massive boulder corals and sea grasses survived in these conditions 	1	2	2
Fabricius has worked in Papua New Guinea  along vents that bubble carbon dioxide into shallow water  giving a good experimental lab to researchers looking at future ocean conditions 	1	2	1
Her research suggests these reefs will still exist in 100 years 	2	1	1
"But they would be much more simple	2	1	1
522 sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897 The complex species are unable to deal with high carbon dioxide situations  she said "	1	1	2
Reefs are hope to hundreds of thousands of species  and replacing the branching coral — with its myriad nooks and crannies for habitat — with boulder coral means a drop in biodiversity 	2	2	2
If you don't have the structure  you don't have the habitat  Fabricius said 	1	1	1
Other parts of the world share a similar story 	1	1	1
Kroeker works in carbon-dioxide-bubbling vents off the coast of Italy 	1	1	1
As waters become more acidic there  Kroeker explained  fewer patches of bright orange-and-pink algae can survive 	1	1	2
"Instead  we see lots of fleshy seaweed 	1	1	1
522 sea-creatures-warming-world-winners-losers-163350897 It looks like a dark mat on the seafloor "	2	1	1
Kroeker’s 2010 meta-analysis detailed in the journal Ecology Letters also showed that crustaceans generally do better than other calcium-carbonate shell-making creatures 	2	2	1
Some lobsters  prawns and crabs actually increase their shell-building when faced with more acidic waters 	1	2	2
Even different algae species differ in their responses to ocean acidification 	1	1	1
Dave Hutchins  a marine biologist at UCLA  said that harmful algae blooms like those that cause red tides are likely to produce more toxins in future ocean conditions 	2	1	2
These blooms cost around $100 million per year in the U S  alone  and may get more toxic in the future  Hutchins told LiveScience  adding that they're a special problem on the West Coast  sea lions washing up around the LA area were poisoned by algae called Pseudo-nitzschia that produce a powerful neurotoxin that leads to memory loss  nerve damage and death 	2	1	3
A group of cyanobacteria called Trichodesmium that turn atmospheric nitrogen into a form other organisms can use for growth are also winners 	1	2	1
His lab has looked at hundreds of generations of algae  and found that they produce far more nitrogen in high carbon-dioxide (CO2) conditions 	2	1	1
For hundreds of generations  we grow them under lab conditions  and their production of nitrogen goes way up under high CO2  he said 	2	1	2
Ocean acidification also interferes with some fish's ability to sense predators 	1	1	2
One bit of research presented at the conference showed that juvenile clownfish lost their ability to sniff out predators in high carbon-dioxide environments 	1	1	2
What Sea-Ice Loss Means for Development in the Arctic	1	1	2
NEW YORK — Arctic sea-ice extent shrank to an unprecedented low this summer  part of a long-term decline in the icy white cap over the far northern ocean 	1	1	2
Researchers predict that nearly ice-free summers are on the way  although it’s not yet clear when this will happen  This shift has implications for climate — in particular  it is expected to aggravate global warming — and for the animals  such as polar bears and walruses  which depend on the ice for habitat 	1	1	2
Siders was among a panel of researchers who discussed the science behind the declining sea ice  the suite of changes occurring in the Arctic and public perception of it  [10 Things You Need to Know About Arctic Sea Ice]	1	1	2
A predictably open Arctic Ocean creates opportunities and challenges for nations that ring the Arctic  Here are some of them 	1	1	1
The opportunities:	1	2	1
Fishing: Warming ocean temperatures  migrating fish and changes in sea ice may create conditions favorable to the development of new commercial fisheries within the Arctic  according to the U S  National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  A U S  plan  approved in 2009  temporarily prohibits commercial fishing in U S  Arctic waters until more information is available 	1	2	2
More ship traffic: A journey through the Northwest Passage north of Canada or along the Northern sea route over Russia can cut thousands of miles off a trip that could otherwise require a ship to travel through the Panama Canal or the Suez Canal  Between 1906 and 2006  only 69 ships traveled through the Northwest Passage  said Michael Byers  professor of political science at the University of British Columbia  in a recent article in the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail  In 2010  18 traveled through  and in 2011  22 made the trip  As ice in the passage has dwindled  tourist trips on cruise ships and private yachts has increased  the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reports 	1	1	1
Gas and oil: The U S  Geological Survey (USGS) estimated in 2008 that the Arctic holds a wealth of undiscovered energy reserves: 90 billion of barrels of oil  1 670 trillion cubic feet (47 3 trillion cubic meters) of natural gas  and 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids —most of it offshore  The quest for these resources is underway  in spite of setbacks  The oil company Shell announced on Monday(Sept  17) it was delaying until next year plans to drill off the Alaskan Arctic coast  The loss of ice would make this prospecting easier 	1	2	1
The problems:	1	1	2
Inadequate maps: The increase in traffic brings up a navigation problem  NOAA's maps and other navigational information are unavailable or outdated in parts of the Arctic Ocean  because thick  impenetrable sea ice kept ships out  In addition  most Arctic waters that are charted were surveyed using obsolete technology dating back to the 1800s  according to NOAA 	1	1	2
"Little infrastructure or support: Alaska has twice the length of coastline as the lower 48 states  but the U S  Coast Guard has extremely limited resources to devote to search-and-rescue operations or to oil spill cleanup  Siders said  Admiral Robert Papp  the Coast Guard commandant  has been quoted in the media as saying  ""The Coast Guard has zero capability in the Arctic  … If we are going to have a permanent presence there  it's going to require some investment  We don't have the infrastructure in place right now "" As an example of when things go wrong: In 2010  a cruise ship called the MV Clipper Adventurer ran aground in the Northwest Passage  and its passengers had to be rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard  [Disasters at Sea: 6 Deadliest Shipwrecks]"	1	1	2
Territorial disagreements: The Arctic coastal nations  the United States  Canada  Russia  Norway and Denmark (Greenland is a Danish territory) are seeking to lay claim to territory far out over the continental shelves  but the United States can't lay its own claim and has little say in others’ because the U S  is not a party to the U N  Law of the Sea Treaty  CNN Money reports  There are other territorial issues as well  for instance  Canada maintains that the Northwest Passage is sovereign Canadian territory  while other nations  including the U S   maintain that it is an international strait 	1	1	2
The loss of summer ice will not  however  transform the Arctic into the Caribbean 	1	1	2
“Some of the challenges to operating in the Arctic are and have been the same for a very long time ” Siders said  adding these will remain at least to some degree  requiring people to work “in the dark  in the cold  in the middle of a storm ” as earlier arrivals have done before 	1	1	2
OLYMPIA  Washington (Reuters) - The Seattle City Council on Monday voted 6-2 in favor of an arena financing deal with hedge fund manager and aspiring NBA franchise owner Chris Hansen that aims to lure the NBA back to the city 	3	3	1
The Pacific Northwest city lost the Seattle SuperSonics to Oklahoma City in 2008  where the team was renamed the Thunder  after the owner faulted city officials for not coming up with a plan to build a new arena 	3	1	2
The team's departure after four decades in Seattle angered basketball fans in the city  and officials are trying to bring back the National Basketball Association to town 	3	2	2
The arena deal builds on a memorandum of understanding struck in May to require an outlay of up to $200 million in public bonds to help pay for the $490 million project 	1	1	1
The public bonds would be repaid by taxes and rent payments generated from the arena 	1	1	1
This may set a new bar for deals that cities strike with pro sports teams  said Seattle City Council President Sally J  Clark  who voted in favor of the agreement 	2	2	1
The two council members voting against the deal acknowledged that their colleagues had extracted relatively favorable terms from Hansen and his partners but said that it was not enough 	2	1	2
This revised agreement may prevent the most problematic outcomes  said Councilman Richard Conlin 	2	2	2
That does not mean that we will wind up benefiting from it or that it is a good use of the city's time  resources or financial capacity 	3	1	2
The King County Council still needs to sign off on the deal before Hansen can begin shopping for a team 	2	2	2
In a statement  King County Councilman Joe McDermott said the county body was likely to do so soon 	1	2	1
I am certain we will stand together with a final in the next few weeks  McDermott said 	3	3	1
Under the agreement  Seattle officials would create a $40 million transportation fund to help offset traffic congestion in the area that could worsen with the new arena 	2	3	2
The new terms also include at least $2 million to spruce up the SuperSonics' old home  Key Arena  up to $5 million to help pay the rent for the WNBA's Seattle Storm should they wind up playing in the new arena  and a personal financial guarantee from Hansen on paying off the arena debt 	2	2	1
Hansen could also be required to buy the new arena for $200 million after 30 years 	1	1	1
The deal is contingent on an environmental assessment of the project that will include an exploration of alternate sites 	1	1	1
Hansen's plan calls for having teams from both the NBA and the National Hockey League play in the new arena  but ground could be broken on the project for an NBA team alone 	1	2	2
This is a magical day and a long time coming  said Kris Brannon  one of a handful of diehard green- and yellow-clad SuperSonics fans that cheered and hugged in the City Council chambers after the votes were tallied 	3	2	1
The team previously expressed an interest in moving to Anaheim in southern California 	1	1	1
Second Kenyan minister charged with inciting violence	1	1	2
NAIROBI (Reuters) - A Kenyan junior minister was charged in court on Thursday with hate speech and inciting violence after calling on members of a tribe to leave a neighborhood in the capital Nairobi 	1	1	3
Ferdinand Waititu is the second minister to be charged with inciting violence in two weeks  raising fears some politicians are still bent on stoking unrest for political gain ahead of a March presidential election 	1	1	2
"The prosecution told the court the assistant minister for water had said words ""calculated to bring violence to members of the Maasai community living and working in Kayole "" a densely-populated neighborhood in his Nairobi constituency of Embakasi "	1	1	2
"He said: ""We do not want to see members of the Maasai in Kayole from today "" according to the prosecution "	2	1	2
Two people were killed in fighting that broke out after Waititu's comments 	1	1	3
Police are investigating whether the violence was linked to his remarks 	1	1	2
Waititu was suspended from ministerial duties until the court case was concluded  President Mwai Kibaki's office said in a statement 	2	1	1
Next year's vote will be the first since the International Criminal Court launched cases against four Kenyans  including two presidential contenders in the 2013 election  over accusations they masterminded tribal violence that killed more than 1 200 people following a disputed 2007 poll 	1	1	3
Many Kenyans are wary of repeat clashes next year and a reconciliation body set up after the last bout of post-election violence has urged politicians to refrain from making inflammatory remarks 	2	1	2
Mzalendo Kibunjia  who chairs the National Cohesion and Integration Commission in Kenya  said he hoped the judicial case against Waititu would deter other politicians from stoking unrest 	2	1	2
"Everybody who wants to campaign on those tired  old terrible politics  there will be no room for you	2	1	2
525 second-kenyan-minister-charged-inciting-violence-175927249 You had better learn new tricks of political mobilization  he told Reuters "	2	1	1
Waititu  a political ally of deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta who is one of the four facing crimes against humanity charges at the International Criminal Court  was remanded in custody until the court decided whether to grant bail 	1	1	1
APOLOGY	1	1	1
"Waititu  from Kenya's Kikuyu group  apologized for his remarks which he called a ""slip of the tongue"" but failed to stop the prosecutor pressing charges  a move broadly supported by a public tired with politicians showing little regard for the law "	2	1	2
Godana pleaded not guilty and was released on bail 	1	1	1
Waititu  who is running for governor of Nairobi  was bound to lose his position as assistant minister under the terms of a new constitution enacted in 2010 	1	1	2
Second time is the charm for Air Force One landing	1	1	1
KENT  Ohio (Reuters) - The presidential jet Air Force One was forced Wednesday to abort an initial landing in Toledo  Ohio  due to fog and rain  and passengers including the president had a bumpy ride 	2	1	1
The plane ferrying President Barack Obama to election campaign events in Ohio took two attempts to land while those aboard were shaken by turbulence 	1	1	1
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney  after consulting with the plane's crew  told journalists travelling with the president that weather was the cause 	2	1	1
The plane landed safely on the second attempt and there were no injuries 	1	2	1
See Annie Star Aileen Quinn All Grown Up!	2	2	1
"It's been 30 years since Aileen Quinn won over the world's heart playing the title role in the big screen version of ""Annie """	4	3	1
At just 9 years old  Aileen beat out 8 000 other little girls hoping to land the role 	3	3	1
What a great actor to work with  she said of Albert  who played Daddy Warbucks 	2	3	1
"Aileen - who had starred in the chorus of the Broadway musical of ""Annie"" - said she didn't have one of Annie's trademark features "	1	1	2
I'm not [a redhead ] I've gone lighter in California with the sunshine  I'm a brunette  she explained 	1	1	1
During Aileen's audition process she and her mother were both convinced that the part was going to another young actress 	1	1	1
"I thought I lost the part the day that I actually got it  she told Billy and Kit  recalling a meeting with director John Huston  ""He asked me questions about my family and my life    [and]I left the audition and my mom said  'Well  let's go get some McDonald's or Burger King  You lost that one ' That was the day he said he knew [I was right for the role after] talking to me """	1	2	2
He was looking for a strength  but also an innocence  she said of the director 	1	1	1

Senate considers political polar bear bill	1	2	2
WASHINGTON (AP) — On its last day in session before the election  the Senate tied itself in knots over 41 polar bear carcasses that hunters want to bring home from Canada as big game trophies 	3	2	3
After punting tough decisions on far weightier issues like raising taxes and cutting spending  Majority Leader Harry Reid  D-Nev   insisted that the Senate address the wide-ranging sportsmen's bill before voting on must-pass legislation to prevent the government from shutting down at the end of next week 	4	2	4
Republicans resisted for a while Friday  contending the only reason Reid wanted the vote now on the bill long sought by hunters and sport fishermen was to benefit Democratic incumbent Jon Tester 's re-election prospects in a tossup race in Montana that could determine which party runs the Senate next year 	2	3	2
This isn't a campaign studio  It's the Senate  Minority Leader Mitch McConnell  R-Ky   complained on the Senate floor Friday 	1	1	2
"We've got responsibilities to meet 	1	2	1
528 senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853 Let's meet them	1	2	1
528 senate-considers-political-polar-bear-bill-022009853 And leave the politics out of it for once "	1	1	2
The House had passed a similar bill in April that was co-sponsored by Rep  Denny Rehberg  Tester's Republican opponent in the Montana Senate race 	1	2	2
In the end  Tester would get only a test vote as the Senate  yet again  punted another issue until after the election 	2	2	2
Tester's bill combines 19 measures favorable to outdoorsmen 	2	1	2
Tester suggested that Friday's compromise allowing for a test vote but delaying a final one exemplifies why Congress has such a poor approval rating from voters 	2	2	3
That might take some of the politics out of it and if we ever made a decision here without politics it would be an earth shattering day  Tester said 	1	1	2
This bill right here is a prime example of what is wrong in Washington  D C  — it's being held up for no reason whatsoever 	1	1	3
The polar bear provision would allow the 41 hunters —including two in Montana — who killed polar bears in Canada just before a 2008 ban on polar bear trophy imports took effect to bring the bears' bodies across the border 	2	2	3
The hunters involved were not able to bring the trophies home before the Fish and Wildlife Services listed them as a threatened species 	1	2	2

"LONDON (Reuters) - More than three decades after ""The Shining"" was first published  the sequel to Stephen King's classic horror novel is finally coming out next year "	3	1	1
The original book was published in 1977  and its success helped establish King's fame as a horror novelist 	1	2	1
Scribner and Hodder & Stoughton have established September 24  2013 as the official first publication date for Doctor Sleep  a sequel to The Shining  King said on his website 	1	1	1
"He uses his gift - the shining - to comfort the dying in a New Hampshire town but his life is upset when he meets a 12-year-old girl who also has the shining and whom he ""must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals "" the website said "	1	2	2
"King has written some 50 novels  including ""Carrie "" ""The Dead Zone"" and ""Misery """	1	1	1
Serb acquitted of setting fire to US Embassy	1	2	1
BELGRADE  Serbia (AP) — A Serbian court on Thursday acquitted the prime suspect charged with setting fire to the U S  Embassy in Belgrade in 2008  but convicted him of the lesser offense of stealing property from the building and sentenced him to a year in prison 	1	2	2
A Belgrade high court judge said there was no evidence that Milan Zivanovic  24  took part in the burning of the embassy when Serb rioters stormed it on Feb  21  2008  in anger over Washington's support for the statehood of Kosovo  the predominantly ethnic Albanian province that had declared independence from Serbia 	1	1	2
The attackers  mostly soccer hooligans  threw stones and flares at the embassy building  breaking windows and setting it on fire  The extremists also attacked other Western embassies in the Serbian capital 	1	1	2
The incident caused tensions in U S -Serbia relations and triggered calls by American officials to bring to justice more perpetrators of the attack  Serbian authorities earlier this year charged another 14 people for the violence 	1	1	2
Serbia lost control over Kosovo after a 1998-99 war but has refused to recognize its independence  About 10 000 people died during the conflict  which ended after NATO bombed Serbia to force it to stop the bloodshed 	1	1	2
Serious Child Abuse Injuries Going Up	3	1	4
The findings  published online in a study in the journal Pediatrics  worry some that the discrepancy may reflect changes in how cases are reported to child agencies and not indicative of a true downturn in cases of child abuse 	1	1	3
Researchers from the Yale School of Medicine found that data from child protective services in the U S  showed a 55 percent decline in verified cases of physical child abuse from 1992 to 2009 in the U S  However  that data didn’t include the number of children who were hospitalized with significant injuries due to child abuse 	3	3	4
“These results highlight the challenges of helping parents do better by their children and the importance of effective prevention programs to reduce serious abusive injuries in young children ” he said 	3	2	3
Leventhal expanded on the reasons behind the discrepancy in a Reuters story: It may be more difficult now for child protective services to verify abuse allegations  and parents may be under more stress due to finances  causing them to take their stress and anger out on their children 	1	1	3
A study in Pediatrics in July found a parallel rise among home foreclosure rates and reported cases of child abuse and head injuries 	1	1	4
Babies  Leventhal told Reuters  may be especially vulnerable to abuse  In the study  the increase in incidence of abuse among children under one year of age went up 10 9 percent 	2	1	4
Infants tend to be hospitalized at a much higher rate than older children  and I think it's because the injuries they sustain are much more serious  he said 	3	1	3

Seriously delinquent mortgages hit three-year low	1	1	1
However  the percentage of seriously delinquent mortgages -- those that are at least 60 days past due or held by bankrupt borrowers — fell to 4 4 percent  the lowest level in three years 	1	2	1
The OCC attributes the year-over-year change to improving economic conditions  servicing transfers and the ongoing effects of both home retention loan modification programs as well as home forfeiture actions 	1	2	1
The percentage of mortgages in the second quarter that were 30 to 59 days past due stood at 2 8 percent  up 12 1 percent from the prior quarter but down 7 5 percent from a year ago 	1	1	1
The report covers 30 5 million first-lien mortgages worth $5 2 trillion in outstanding balances 	1	1	1
Shuttle to sightsee around Calif with low flyovers	1	1	1
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Space shuttle Endeavour will spend its last flying day Friday not rocketing into space  but doing what most tourists do when visiting California: Taking in the state Capitol  Golden Gate Bridge and the Hollywood Sign 	2	1	1
It's Endeavour's last aerial hurrah before it spends its retirement years as a museum piece 	3	2	1
We want people to take in this majestic show  Los Angeles police Cmdr 	3	1	1
Scott Kroeber said earlier this week 	1	1	1
But if you're driving  please drive and don't try to take in the show simultaneously 	3	1	1
Extra officers will be on duty along the freeways near LAX to make sure traffic flows smoothly as the shuttle zooms overhead 	1	1	1
Endeavour returned to its birthplace Thursday after an emotional cross-country ferry flight that made a special flyover of Tucson  Ariz   to honor its last commander  Mark Kelly and his wife  former Arizona Rep  Gabrielle Giffords 	2	2	1
NASA's shuttle fleet  which retired last year after three decades of flight  was assembled in Palmdale near Edwards Air Force Base 	1	1	1
The military outpost 100 miles north of Los Angeles served as the original shuttle landing strip and remained a backup site in case of stormy weather at Cape Canaveral  Fla 	1	1	1
The youngest shuttle  Endeavour replaced Challenger  which blew up during liftoff in 1986 	1	1	2
NASA lost another shuttle  Columbia  in 2003 when it disintegrated during re-entry 	1	1	2
During 25 missions  Endeavour spent 299 days in space and orbited Earth nearly 4 700 times  racking up 123 million miles 	1	1	1
On its maiden flight in 1992  a trio of spacewalking astronauts grabbed a stranded communications satellite in for repair 	1	1	1
It also flew the first repair mission to the Hubble Space Telescope to fix a faulty mirror 	1	1	1
But most of its flights ferried cargo and equipment to the International Space Station  which is near completion 	1	1	1
Under White House orders to explore beyond low-Earth orbit  NASA is hitching rides on Russian rockets to the orbiting laboratory until private companies can provide regular service 	1	1	1
Endeavour is the second of three remaining shuttles to head to its retirement home 	1	1	1
In April  Discovery arrived at the Smithsonian Institution's hangar in Virginia 	1	1	1
Endeavour will remain at an airport hangar for several weeks as crews ready the shuttle for its own road trip 	1	1	1
Unlike Atlantis  it will creep through city streets to the California Science Center near downtown 	1	1	1
Some 400 trees will be cleared along the 12-mile route to make room  a move that has riled some residents in affected neighborhoods 	1	1	2

Sign of the times _ baseball autographs go hi tech	1	1	1
So when he noticed Mattingly was participating in a startup venture called Egraphs  which offered an autographed digital picture with a handwritten note and a personalized audio message  he didn't think twice about paying $50  Nash never would have walked up to the Los Angeles Dodgers manager and asked for his signature 	1	2	1
It's actually kind of cool  It's like new age for me  Mattingly said 	2	2	1
David Auld  a former Microsoft employee who is the Seattle-based company's chief executive officer  started the venture last October and brought in former major leaguer Gabe Kapler as director of business development  Kapler was contacted by Auld's brother  Brian  the senior vice president of business operations for the Tampa Bay Rays  Kapler's team from 2009-10 	1	2	1
Taking the cold out of the autograph experience with the celebrity made a lot of sense  Kapler said 	1	2	1
In an era in which players carry iPads and wireless has become more ever-present in clubhouses than smokeless tobacco  the idea seems to have caught on rather quickly  Among the early players to sign up were Tampa Bay's David Price and manager Joe Maddon 	1	2	1
The company's website  www egraphs com  lists about 130 players  with several sold out — including David Ortiz  Josh Hamilton  Prince Fielder and CC Sabathia 	1	2	1
Prices range from $25 to $100  depending on the player 	1	1	1
For the players  the process is relatively easy and speedy 	1	2	1
"We built a custom iPad application  said David Auld  who used engineers he knew from high school  ""They record an audio message through the iPad microphone """	1	1	1
Consumers can share their Egraph on social networks and purchase a framed print with a certificate of authenticity  Each signature and recording is biometrically verified 	1	2	1
"It's cool  The best part of that is the audio  said New York Mets 20-game winner R A  Dickey  ""I get to give an audio message to a fan  which is pretty neat """	2	2	1
Each of Dickey's messages is different 	1	1	1
It all depends on the note that they write and what they share  he said 	2	1	1
To make sure that the idea couldn't be copied within the sport  Egraphs obtained exclusive licenses with Major League Baseball and with Major League Baseball Advanced Media  its Internet division 	1	2	1
"Every month I get a really cool idea and say  'How are you going to do that?' explained Smith  entering his 15th year with the commissioner's office  ""The technology they have in terms of safeguarding for the athlete  in terms of merchandizing  it has extensions well beyond this  well beyond autographs  well beyond licensed products """	1	2	1
Auld won't divulge the volume of the company's sales  Kapler envisions an expansion to musicians and hopes for the day when Mariah Carey can send audio birthday greetings to fans  Auld sees minor leaguers getting involved to become better known to fans of their parent clubs and envisions international sports stars signing up 	2	2	1
"For Brandon Steiner  whose Steiner Sports sells autographed photos and memorabilia costing hundreds of dollars and more  Egraphs is something ""aimed at the lower end of the market"" and a product ""that doesn't have legs """	1	1	2
"I don't understand how that's a collectible  said Steiner  whose company began in 1987  ""I don't understand why somebody would want that  a facsimile autograph  It's kind of like a replica jersey that people get when they're 6 years old """	2	1	2
Mattingly  for one  likes the high-tech approach 	1	2	1
"Let's say you would sign for a Steiner or a different company like that  you would sign about 200 things  You don't know where they're going or how they're going  But this is kind of cool because you kind of have a little background of who it is and how they're connected with you  You actually get a message from the person  like: 'This is Bill and Angie  We're getting married  and we've been big fans of yours ' he said  ""And then when you leave your little voice mail  it's almost like saying: 'Hey Bill and Angie  congratulations on getting married  Thanks for being a fan ' So it actually feels a bit more personal than it would be if you were to do some of the stuff in bulk "	2	2	1
EL PASO  Texas - Singer-songwriter Fiona Apple has been arrested for hashish possession at a West Texas town after a Border Patrol drug-sniffing dog detected marijuana in her tour bus 	1	1	3
Hudspeth County sheriff's office spokesman Rusty Flemming says Apple spent Wednesday night in the county jail and was released Thursday on a $10 000 bond 	2	1	3
Fleming says marijuana possession in small amounts is a misdemeanour  while hashish in any quantity is a felony in Texas 	2	1	3

Skiers  rowers may not have more back pain	1	2	1
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Despite putting constant stress on their backs  rowers and cross-country skiers may not have any more chronic lower back pain than the rest of us  a new study suggests 	1	3	2
Elite athletes in certain sports that ask a lot of the spine - like gymnastics and wrestling - have been found that have an increased risk of lower back pain 	2	1	3
Rowers and cross-country skiers don't have to bend themselves backwards  But they do have to flex and extend their spines  over and over again 	1	1	1
They expose their backs to monotonous movements for a number of years  said Ida Stange Foss  of the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences in Oslo  the lead researcher on the study 	2	1	1
Yet in the long run  Foss's team found  elite rowers and skiers may have no more lower back woes than people who get their sports on TV 	2	2	1
Of 415 former rowers and cross-country skiers surveyed  about 56 percent said they'd had any lower back pain in the past year  That compared with 53 percent of non-athletes - a difference that could have been due to chance 	1	1	2
This is an important and positive message for the athletes  Foss said in an email 	3	3	1
However  the news was not all good  Rowers and skiers who'd trained harder in the past year - more than 550 hours - were also more likely to have had a bout of low back pain in the past year 	2	1	3
"The pain was generally short-lived  ""Most of the elite athletes reported a pain duration between one and seven days  (or) eight to 30 days during the past year "" Foss said  ""Very few reported pain lasting for more than one month """	2	2	2
Still  that means active rowers and cross-country skiers might need to take steps to protect their backs 	1	1	2
The study  published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine  included 173 rowers and 242 cross-country skiers who'd been surveyed back in 2000  Foss's team surveyed them again in 2010  asking about their training and exercise levels over the past decade  any problems with back pain 	1	1	1
Most people in each group - around two-thirds - said they'd had low back pain at some point in their lives  Of the athletes  17 to 19 percent said they'd had pain in the past week  as did 20 percent of the less sporty group 	1	1	2
Other studies have found that when it comes to exercise and back pain  extremes matter: Both couch potatoes and heavy-training athletes may be at increased risk 	3	1	3
Skiers  rowers may not have more back pain: study	1	2	1
(Reuters) - Competitive rowers and cross-country skiers may not have any more chronic lower back pain than the rest of us despite putting constant stress on their backs  according to a Norwegian study 	1	2	2
Rowers and cross-country skiers don't have to bend themselves backwards  but they do have to flex and extend their spines  over and over again 	1	2	2

Foss's team surveyed them again in 2010  asking about their training and exercise levels over the past decade and any problems with back pain 	1	1	1
For comparison  the researchers surveyed 116 non-athletes and 209 athletes in orienteering  a sport that involves outdoor running and no specific strain on the back 	1	1	1
Other studies have found that when it comes to exercise and back pain  extremes matter 	1	1	1
Both couch potatoes and heavy-training athletes may be at increased risk 	1	1	2
Back in the 2000 survey of these same athletes  the researchers did find that lower back pain became more common as rowers and skiers bumped up their training to get ready for competition 	1	1	2
"Cross-country skiers had more pain when they used ""classic"" techniques rather than freestyle  Foss added "	1	1	2
These findings indicate that it is important to vary movement patterns and techniques  especially during intense training periods  she said 	2	1	1

The Labor Department this week reported what many Americans already know: The cost of having a smartphone is eating up an increasingly large chunk of monthly budgets 	2	1	2
How much has smartphone spending grown?	1	1	1
American households on average spent $1 226 on their smartphones in 2011  up from $1 110 in 2007 	1	1	1
While that may not sound like a huge increase  consider that total expenditures per family rose only $67 in that period 	3	1	1
That means Americans were cutting back big time on other expenses 	2	1	1
Since 2007  annual spending on food fell by $48  apparel by $141  and non-phone entertainment by $126 	1	1	1
And are smartphones going to get more expensive?	1	1	1
Yes 	1	1	1
Just as consumers have grown accustomed to watching videos on their phones  wireless carriers are rolling out plans to squeeze out more money from data usage 	2	1	2
Streaming 30 minutes of video per day over a 4G connection and doing nothing else can cost $120 a month on a new Verizon data plan  says Troianovski 	2	1	1
Carriers earned $59 billion in data revenue in 2011  and they are expected to haul in an additional $50 billion per year by 2017 	1	2	1
"They certainly could cut back on their data usage  but ever since the iPhone came out in 2007  ""nobody ever looked back "" says Nathan Snyder at Android Authority "	3	1	1
This is just sad  says Hamilton Nolan at Gawker 	3	1	2
We are choosing to forgo going out in order to spend more time with our phones 	3	1	1
Don't smartphones save families some money though?	2	2	1
Some of today's telephone spending means less spending elsewhere  says Ryan Chittum at The Columbia Journalism Review 	2	1	1
When one device consolidates functions formerly performed by the calendar  notebook  video camera  music player  map  newspaper  and more  you need to spend less on those things 	3	1	1
And aren't there bigger factors affecting family budgets?	1	1	1
Yes 	1	1	1

How a Sneaky Sundew Hurls Insects Into Its Trap	1	1	1
The twitchy tentacles of a sundew can catapult prey into the carnivorous plant's sticky traps in a fraction of a second  researchers say 	1	1	1
These fast-moving snares are among the quickest seen yet in the plant kingdom  the scientists added 	1	1	1
"Researchers investigated a sundew plant from southern Australia  Drosera glanduligera  whose ""flower"" trap grows up to 1 5 inches (4 centimeters) wide "	1	1	1
Sundews get their name from the sticky drops resembling the morning dew at the end of each of their tentacles 	1	1	1
Carnivorous plants such as sundews go after meat to help them survive in the nutrient-poor soils they call home 	1	1	1
Past research showed D  glanduligera has a way of ensnaring prey that is unique among carnivorous plants 	1	1	1
In addition to its sticky tentacles  this sundew possesses longer  touch-sensitive tentacles that can snap forward  hurling insects at its flypaper-like glue traps 	1	1	1
The sticky tentacles then slowly bend to move the prey to spoon-shaped leaves  from where it is slowly digested 	1	1	1
To show for the first time how these tentacles work  scientists collaborated with private sundew cultivators 	1	1	1
They analyzed these plants with microscopes and high-speed video cameras in the lab  testing the sundews with fruit flies 	1	1	1
D  glanduligera is not only extremely tough to cultivate by needing high-temperature fluctuations between day (above 20 degrees C) and night (close to zero degrees C) and regular feeding with flaked fish food and fruit flies  it also grows for only a few months from germination until seed production and wilting  wrote researcher Simon Poppinga  a botanist at the University of Freiburg in Germany  in an email 	2	1	1
We hence had a very small time slot to accomplish all experiments needed 	2	1	1
The secret to the quick tentacles probably involves releasing pent-up hydraulic pressure in a sudden burst  the researchers found 	1	1	1
And it happens fast 	1	1	1
"The sundew takes about 75 milliseconds to catapult prey with snap tentacles  ""which is by far the fastest motion reported from the sundew genus "" Speck told LiveScience "	1	1	1
It is quick enough to outsmart walking prey animals  and is a bit faster than the snap-trapping action of the famous and closely related Venus flytrap and waterwheel plant 	1	1	1
"However  the title of fastest predator in the plant kingdom belongs to another plant  the bladderwort Utricularia  ""which features traps that suck in their prey in less than a millisecond "" Poppinga said "	1	1	1
These snap tentacles are each one-shot weapons  with their hinges essentially breaking after they catapult  the researchers found 	1	1	1
The researchers suggest the snap tentacles extend the range of each plant beyond just their glue traps and perhaps help them capture larger animals that might ordinarily be strong enough to free themselves from a sticky tentacle 	2	1	1
Future research will endeavor to see how these carnivorous plants behave outside the lab in the wild and what prey they catch 	1	1	1
Fruit flies are definitely not the main prey in the natural habitat  Speck said 	2	1	1
The scientists detailed their findings online Sept  26 in the journal PLoS ONE 	1	1	1
Snedeker makes a push for FedEx Cup	1	1	1
It could turn out to be a round worth $10 million 	2	2	1
Sunday at East Lake is the final day of the FedEx Cup  and it has never been more up for grabs among so many top players 	2	2	1
Rory McIlroy had a 68 — his 11th consecutive round in the 60s — and was three shots behind 	1	2	1
It's going to be one of the most exciting Sundays of the year  McIlroy said 	3	3	1
Rose will be in the final group with Snedeker  and while it's unlikely he can win the FedEx Cup  the Englishman surely would settle for his second win of the year against a strong field 	3	2	2
Snedeker and Rose were at 8-under 202 	1	2	1
Ryan Moore spoiled his round with a bogey on the 17th and still had a 65  putting him alone in third at 6-under 204 	2	2	2
Jim Furyk  the 36-hole leader  was tied for the lead until he pulled his tee shot into the water on the 17th  hit the next tee shot into the gallery  his fourth shot into a bunker and made triple bogey that sent him tumbling down to a 72 	2	2	2
Typical of the FedEx Cup playoffs  there was plenty of star power in contention  with 11 of the top 14 players on the leaderboard headed to the Ryder Cup next week 	1	2	1
For now  the attention shifts in a big way to the $10 million payoff 	2	1	1

Snedeker also shot a 64 in the second round of the British Open at Royal Lytham & St  Annes  though he rated this one as better 	2	2	1
East Lake demanded a crisp game as the wind rustled pine branches and the greens became firm 	1	1	2
It was so tough today  Snedeker said 	3	1	2
"The wind made it so hard to hit the fairways here because the wind seemed like it would move the ball 4 or 5 yards one way or the other  and these fairways might be 15 yards side	3	1	2

"REFILE-Soccer-Angry Friedel fires Twitter broadside at ""ignorant"" Barthez"	2	1	2
"LONDON  Sept 21 (Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur's Brad Friedel has called former France keeper Fabien Barthez ""ignorant and disrespectful"" for saying current France No 1 Hugo Lloris should be starting for the Premier League club instead of him "	3	1	2
Lloris joined Tottenham on the final day of the last transfer window for 12 million pounds ($19 51 million) and had been widely expected to go straight into the team 	2	1	1
Friedel  however  has played in all four league matches this season with Lloris sitting out encounters against Norwich City and Reading and only making his debut in Thursday's goalless Europa League match against Lazio 	2	1	1

"Tottenham will not let him stay on the bench for a long time """	2	1	1
Friedel  41  has made 308 consecutive Premier League appearances since 2004 for Blackburn Rovers  Aston Villa and Tottenham and the former U S  keeper has been a reliable performer this season despite Spurs' slow start 	2	1	1
"He was so angered by Barthez's comments  he used his Twitter account "" friedel_f"" to say: ""Just saw Barthez comments "	2	1	2

Soccer-Ranegie in Sweden squad despite Twitter protest	2	1	1
Ranegie was disappointed not to be called up for a friendly against Brazil in August  and responded to the coach's decision by tweeting a link to a video showcasing Hamren's less-than-perfect English 	3	1	2
"Naming the striker in his squad on Tuesday  a smiling Hamren told a media conference that he had not seen the video  saying ""maybe he thinks I performed well with my English "	2	1	1

How Is Social Media Changing Diplomacy?	1	1	1
"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton advocates for what she calls ""twenty-first century statecraft "" the use of technology and social media by ambassadors and their staff to connect and engage with their local communities "	2	1	1
But can Facebook and Twitter really change the art of diplomacy?	2	1	1
That was one question posed to Deputy Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs for Digital Strategy at the State Department Victoria Esser  Indonesian Ambassador to the United States Dr  Dino Patti Djalal  Mexican Ambassador to the United States Arturo Sarukhan Casamitjana and American Ambassador to Zimbabwe Charles Ray during a panel at the 2012 Social Good Summit 	2	1	1
"[Social media] is an integral part of how we're conducting our diplomacy around the world  said Esser	2	1	1
545 social-media-changing-diplomacy-163316558 We have 300 Twitter profiles  400 Facebook pages "	2	1	1
"To me  it's about creating virtuous circles online and offline -- nothing will replace face-to-face diplomacy  but social media is an important way to connect with people and cut away time  distance and diplomatic rank barriers and have a real conversation """	4	2	1
Esser pointed to a recent State Department experiment with Google Hangouts as an example of such a conversation 	1	1	1
We were trying to figure out a way to really engage in a dialogue in Iran  where we don't have a diplomatic presence 	2	1	1
Esser  subtly acknowledging the situation at the American Embassy in Cairo wherein a staffer sent tweets later reported to have gone without authorization  also said that Washington largely gives individual missions free reign to tweet as they will 	3	2	2
"We've devolved [control] so missions in the field are responsible  with general guidance from Washington	2	1	1
545 social-media-changing-diplomacy-163316558 You can't manage a tweet at a time  and it's important not to or it won't be authentic to the community you're trying to engage with	2	1	2

545 social-media-changing-diplomacy-163316558 If you want to engage in this dialogue  there's a certain loss in control involved "	2	1	2
Ambassador Ray shared a unique story of using Facebook to circumvent a local government's obstructionism 	1	1	1
If not for social media  I'd have no other medium to reach out to [Indonesians]  said Djalal  who only started tweeting when he first became an ambassador 	2	1	1

Sorry Marketers  You're Doing Facebook Wrong [REPORT]	2	1	2
"That's the advice from Buddy Media's ""Strategies for Effective Wall Posts: A Timeline Analysis "" a report based on activity from 1 800 of the world's biggest brand pages from April 1 to May 31 "	2	1	1
As with previous Buddy Media reports on the subject  the analysis found that marketers are still posting too little on weekends and at night and when they do post  they're way too verbose 	1	1	1
"For ""advertising and consulting "" for example  weekend posts get 69% higher interaction  but only 11% of posts are published on Saturday and Sunday "	1	1	1
In general  though  Hump Day is the worst day to post  interactions on Wednesday are 7 4% lower than average 	1	1	2
Once again  the study also found that off-hours are the best time to post 	1	1	1
The key is not to bombard fans with too many posts  as Facebook News Feed optimization often penalizes for this  the report cautions 	2	1	2
Such posts get a 23% higher interaction than longer posts 	1	1	1
However  75% of posts are beyond that limit 	1	1	1
It's also a good idea to run photos -- photo posts get 39% higher interaction rates than average 	1	1	1
Video and link posts appear to be the worst option: They have lower-than-average interaction rates 	1	1	1

Space Shuttle Endeavour Departs Florida on Final Ferry Flight	1	1	1
CAPE CANAVERAL  Fla  — For the last time in history  a space shuttle soared into the skies over Florida on Wednesday (Sept 	1	1	1
Rather than riding on rockets and heading into orbit however  the space shuttle Endeavour was mounted atop a jumbo jet and is destined for a California museum's display 	1	1	1
The retired orbiter  mated to the space agency's modified Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) took off from the Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Landing Facility  which was the same runway where Endeavour made its 25th and final return from space in June 2011 	1	1	1
The 7:22 a m  EDT (1122 GMT) liftoff marked the start of the final ferry flight for the 30-year space shuttle program 	1	1	1
After taking to the air  Endeavour  riding piggyback on the SCA  embarked on a series of flyovers of Florida's Space Coast 	1	1	1
The air- and- spacecraft duo flew over Kennedy and its visitor complex  the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Patrick Air Force Base before returning to the landing facility for one last low pass 	1	1	1
It then headed west to cross out of the Sunshine State 	1	1	1
Endeavour's final departure from Florida had been delayed twice by weather 	1	1	2
The SCA with its last shuttle passenger aboard was originally scheduled to takeoff on Monday  but a low pressure front and associated thunderstorms along the planned flight path necessitated NASA postponing the takeoff to Wednesday 	1	1	2
In April 2011  NASA awarded Endeavour to the California Science Center (CSC) in Los Angeles for its permanent display 	1	1	1
The ferry flight is scheduled to touch down at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on Friday (Sept 	1	1	1
PDT (2 p m  EDT  1800 GMT) 	1	1	1
Before then  it will make flyovers and stopovers at NASA facilities and centers  as well as take scenic tours over many California landmarks 	1	1	1
The first leg on Endeavour's cross-country trip is taking it Houston  the home of the space shuttle program  Mission Control and NASA's astronaut corps 	1	1	1
The two sites tested the shuttle engines and built the external fuel tanks  respectively 	1	1	1
EDT  1400-1530 GMT) and fly near a variety of landmarks in the greater Houston area  including the George Bush Intercontinental and William P  Hobby airports as well as the downtown skyline and the San Jacinto Monument 	1	1	1
The SCA with Endeavour will also navigate a low flyover of NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) 	1	1	1
At approximately 10:45 a m 	1	1	1
CDT (11:45 a m 	1	1	1
EDT  1545 GMT)  the SCA is expected to land at Ellington Field in Houston and taxi to NASA Hangar 990 	1	1	1
Public viewing of the aircraft and Endeavour will begin a half hour after the vehicles are safely secured and continue until 9 p m  (10 p m  EDT  0200 GMT) 	1	1	1
Endeavour's Ellington arrival on this  its final flight  brings this particular shuttle's history full circle 	1	1	1
On May 9  1991  Endeavour arrived at the same air field during a refueling stop on its very first ferry flight 	1	1	1
Endeavour was on its way from California to Florida to be readied for its first mission  STS-49  which launched a year later 	1	1	1
Ellington Field is the aircraft operations base for Johnson Space Center 	1	1	1
In addition to the SCA  Ellington supports NASA's Super Guppy cargo plane  the now retired Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA) Gulfstream jets  and NASA's fleet of T-38 two-engine astronaut training jets 	1	1	1
Go west  young shuttle  go west	2	1	1
Before the weather delayed its Florida departure  the SCA and Endeavour were to scheduled to stay in Houston for two days 	1	1	1
Instead  the shuttle  atop the jetliner  will leave Ellington at sunrise on Thursday (Sept 	1	1	1
20) 	1	1	1
Ellington's runway is not quite long enough to support a fully-fueled  shuttle-carrying SCA for this flight  and so the jumbo jet will make an additional re-fueling stop at Biggs Army Air Field in El Paso  Texas  before continuing on its way to southern California 	2	1	1
On the way  the SCA will make low flyovers of the White Sands Test Facility near Las Cruces  N M   and NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base in California  prior to landing around mid-day at Dryden 	1	1	1
On the morning of Sept  21  the SCA and Endeavour will take off for the last time and fly low passes over northern California  passing near NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field and by various landmarks in multiple cities  including Sacramento and San Francisco 	1	1	1
The aircraft with Endeavour will also fly over many Los Angeles landmarks before touching down at LAX 	1	1	1
Once on the ground and following a ceremony welcoming Endeavour to Los Angeles  the shuttle will be removed from the SCA and spend a few weeks at a United Airlines hangar undergoing preparations for transport and display 	1	1	1
Endeavour will then travel through the streets of Inglewood and Los Angeles on a two-day  12-mile (19-kilometer) road trip from the airport to the science center  arriving on the evening of Oct  13 	1	1	1
Beginning Oct  30  the shuttle will debut on display in the science center's Samuel Oschin Space Shuttle Endeavour Display Pavilion  beginning its new educational mission to commemorate past achievements in space and inspire the next generations of explorers 	1	1	1
Space shuttle Endeavour takes to California skies	1	1	1
Riding piggyback atop a modified 747 jumbo jet  the shuttle departed Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert on Friday morning 	1	1	1
The pair overnighted at the base 100 miles north of Los Angeles after a cross-country flight 	1	1	1
Then it will head to the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles basin  buzzing by landmarks including the Golden Gate Bridge before landing at the Los Angeles International Airport 	1	1	1
The flyovers will last nearly five hours 	1	1	1
Throngs of spectators are expected to watch Endeavour in the air before it retires to a Los Angeles museum 	2	1	1

Spain dedicated to fiscal reform  sacrifice must be spread: Rajoy	1	1	1
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Spain is committed to fiscal and structural reforms and all parts of Spanish society will need to make sacrifices to achieve these ends  Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said on Wednesday 	2	2	2
"We know what we have to do  and since we know it  we're doing it	3	1	1

Violent protests in Madrid against tough economic reforms and growing secession talk in the wealthy Catalonia region have increased the pressure on the government to seek external aid to help get public finances in order 	1	1	2
Spain has been reluctant to seek help  but in an interview with the Wall Street Journal this week  Rajoy said he would seek a bailout if Spanish debt financing costs remained too high for too long 	2	1	2
MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's economic crisis is exposing deep regional fault lines 	2	1	2
Among Catalans on Barcelona's boulevards the talk is of independence  and Madrid is worried 	3	1	2
This week the king and prime minister called for national unity to get Spain through its worst downturn in decades  King Juan Carlos recalling the spirit that built a democracy after dictator Francisco Franco's death in 1975 	2	1	3
Popular momentum for independence has never been stronger in Catalonia  a wealthy region in northeastern Spain that generates one fifth of the country's economic output and is home to 16 percent of Spaniards 	3	1	1
Still  few see a rapid road to an independent Catalonia  a dream rooted in the Middle Ages when Barcelona was a Mediterranean trade centre with a parliament 	2	1	1
The central government collects most taxation payments then redistributes them to Spain's 17 self-governing regions  which run their own schools and hospitals 	1	1	1
Each year Catalans say they pay 16 billion euros more in taxes than the regional government spends 	1	1	1
"The crisis has shown that Spain's regional financing model does not work 	1	1	2
555 spain-economic-crisis-fans-catalan-separatism-060303603--business There is no doubt we need to advance towards a federal system of taxation  said Jose Ignacio Conde-Ruiz  deputy head of think-tank FEDEA "	2	1	1
The flare-up in Catalonia has come at a difficult time for Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy who is struggling to bring Spain's deficit under control and resisting following Greece  Ireland and Portugal into an international bailout 	2	1	2
Catalonia is likely to miss its deficit target this year and has had to ask Madrid for a 5 billion euro bailout to meet its debt redemptions 	1	1	2
DIFFERENCES RUN DEEP	3	1	1
Children are schooled in Catalan and Spanish is treated as a foreign language in the home region of Joan Miro  Salvador Dali and Antoni Gaudi 	1	1	1
Catalans banned bullfighting in a 2010 referendum highlighting their difference from the rest of Spain 	2	1	1
Catalan President Artur Mas  of the conservative Convergence and Union  or CiU  up until last week an advocate of autonomy but not of independence  has fallen into line with public opinion 	2	1	1
He says he will work toward a referendum like the one Scotland may hold in 2014 on breaking its 305-year union with England 	1	1	1
We went one way for 30 years and now there's a change in direction     Catalonia needs instruments of state  he told Madrid's political and business elite at a forum last week 	1	1	1
Even if it had to pay for its own military and diplomatic corps  the financial benefit to Catalonia would be equivalent to seven percent of its GDP  says Elisenda Paluzie  dean of the economics and business school at the University of Barcelona 	2	2	1
Mas and Rajoy are scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss Mas's proposals to free Catalonia from the common tax regime 	1	1	1

Spain loses capital in July for 13th month	1	1	2
Bank of Spain data showed on Friday that capital outflows  excluding central bank operations  amounted to 15 billion euros ($19 3 billion) in July  down from 56 6 billion euros in June 	1	1	2
A total of 331 billion euros of capital has left the country in the 13 months to end-July  equivalent to around a third of the output of the euro zone's fourth-largest economy 	2	1	2
The reduced outflow from June to July was mostly due to fewer interbank operations that involved withdrawing money from Spain  one analyst said  adding that this was volatile data and that not too much should be read into it 	3	1	2
Spain's current account was in surplus by 499 7 million euros in July  the data showed  up from a deficit of 257 2 million euros in June  partly due to inflows of summer tourism revenues 	1	1	2
The government announced more economic reforms and a tough 2013 budget this week in steps seen as preempting the strict terms of any international bailout to reduce the country's high borrowing costs 	2	1	2
Spain is in talks with Brussels about the terms of a possible aid package that would trigger a European Central Bank bond-buying program 	2	1	2
The Bank of Spain data is not the first to show a lessening of capital outflows in recent months 	1	1	1
Consumers and firms pulled money out of Spanish banks in August at a slower rate than in July  although private sector deposits fell to a more than three-year low  ECB data showed on Thursday 	1	1	2

Streisand  Minnelli  Franklin sing for Marvin Hamlisch	1	2	1
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three of America's leading stage performers - Barbra Streisand  Liza Minnelli and Aretha Franklin - paid tribute to Marvin Hamlisch on Tuesday  honoring the late composer for his contributions to Broadway and movies  as well as their personal lives 	2	3	1
"The invitation-only tribute for the composer of numerous hit records  movies and musicals such as ""A Chorus Line"" was held at the New York's Juilliard School for the Arts where Hamlisch studied as a boy after three years earlier displaying at the age of 4 a gift for mimicking music "	2	2	1
Hamlisch died after a brief illness in Los Angeles on August 6 at the age of 68  causing an outpouring of grief from well-known entertainers and fans and prompting Streisand  Hamlisch's friend for the past 45 years  to organize the tribute 	2	3	3
"Streisand performed ""The Way We Were - one of Hamlisch's best known songs and one of Streisand's biggest hits - in the tribute's finale "	2	3	1
"She also recalled how they first met in 1963 when Hamlisch was the rehearsal pianist for Streisand's movie ""Funny Girl "" who would also on occasion fetch the cast coffee "	2	2	1
Because I didn't drink coffee  he was assigned to get me a chocolate doughnut  Streisand told the laughing audience filled with friends  family and stars including Michael Douglas  Sarah Jessica Parker and lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman 	3	3	1
But instead of just one  he always brought me two and so our love affair began 	3	4	1
"Streisand told how she forged a friendship with the New York-born composer based on a shared passion for ""music  film and food "" and ""without explaining why or how  we understood each others anxieties "" while joking about their shared Jewish heritage "	3	3	1
MINNELLI'S CONSTANT	1	1	1
"They ended up with a long history of working together  including Hamlisch's turn as musical director and arranger of Streisand's 1994 U S  concert tour as well as writing the score for Streisand's 1996 film  ""The Mirror Has Two Faces """	2	2	1
"Hamlisch had called Streisand ""the best voice there is """	3	4	1
"Earlier Liza Minnelli  who performed ""If You Really Knew Me"" from Hamlisch's Tony-nominated 1979 musical  ""They're Playing Our Song "" said she met the composer  ""when I was 14 and a half  and he was 15 and three-quarters "" and soon became best friends: ""He was one of my few constants that I had in my life """	3	3	1
"Aretha Franklin sang a rousing version of Hamlisch's power ballad ""Nobody Does It Better "" which he wrote as the theme song for the 1977 James Bond film ""The Spy Who Loved Me """	2	2	1
"She inserted the lyric  ""Marvin  you are the best"" to audience cheers before lowering her voice for the spiritual ballad ""Deep River """	2	3	1
"Other performers included Chinese pianist Lang Lang  British stage singer Maria Friedman and trumpeter Chris Botti who all performed songs from the 1975 musical ""A Chorus Line "" for which Hamlisch won a Tony award and a Pulitzer Prize and which at the time became the most successful show on Broadway "	2	3	1
"Hamlisch worked right up until the days before his death and the tribute showed off one of his more recent songs about his love for life  ""While I Still Have The Time "" from the Jerry Lewis stage-adapted comedy musical  ""The Nutty Professor "" which opened this year "	2	2	1
Hamlisch had the rare distinction of winning Emmy  Grammy  Oscar and Tony awards 	1	3	1
His wife  Terre Blair Hamlisch  began the tribute recalling how Hamlisch often said he believed in the power of music to connect people  and Streisand ended it 90 minutes later 	2	2	1
A scholarship program at The Juilliard School was established in Hamlisch's memory 	1	2	1
NEW YORK (AP) — Barbra Streisand  Aretha Franklin and Liza Minnelli took turns singing songs by the late Marvin Hamlisch during a stirring memorial service for the composer on Tuesday 	1	1	1
The composer's wife of 26 years  Terre Hamlisch  welcomed the crowd 	1	2	1
"Hamlisch composed or arranged hundreds of scores for musicals and movies  including ""A Chorus Line"" on Broadway and the films ""The Sting "" ''Sophie's Choice "" ''Ordinary People"" and ""The Way We Were "" He died on Aug  6 in Los Angeles at age 68 after a short illness "	1	1	2
Since Streisand didn't drink coffee  he would bring her chocolate doughnuts 	1	2	1
"Their lives would intersect in personal and professional ways over the years  She sang his ""The Way We Were"" to a Grammy Award win in 1974  and he played at her wedding in 1998 "	1	2	1
"Franklin  in a white suit  changed some of the lyrics to the sexy James Bond song ""Nobody Does It Better "" to ""Marvin  you were the best "" Hamlisch had co-written the No  1 R&B hit ""Break It to Me Gently"" with Carole Bayer Sager for Franklin "	1	2	1
"He was one of my few constants  she said  getting teary on stage  ""He was always there  He always was and always will be """	1	2	2
There were few seats available in the 900-seat theater at The Juilliard School  where decades before Hamlisch had become its youngest person accepted at just age 7  His widow urged the crowd to fund scholarships in his memory 	1	2	1
Hamlisch went on to became one of the most decorated artists in history  winning three Oscars  four Emmys  four Grammys  a Tony  a Pulitzer and two Golden Globes 	1	3	1
The 90-minute memorial  which also boasted performances by Itzhak Perlman  Michael Feinstein  Chris Botti and Maria Friedman  took place on a stage dominated by a huge photo of Hamlisch and two towers of flowers on either side  Performers would blow the photo kisses or bow to it after their turns on stage 	1	2	1
Hamlisch's funeral was held Aug  14 at Congregation Emanu-El  a prominent Manhattan synagogue where legendary songwriter George Gershwin's funeral was held in 1937  Former President Bill Clinton and Sir Howard Stringer  chairman of Sony Corp   eulogized Hamlisch 	1	2	1
"Hamlisch received a Tony and a Pulitzer for ""A Chorus Line "" the second-longest-running American show in Broadway history  and wrote the music for other stage hits such as ""The Goodbye Girl"" and ""Sweet Smell of Success """	1	2	1
"He was working on a new musical  ""Gotta Dance "" at the time of his death and was scheduled to write the score for a new Steven Soderbergh film on Liberace  ""Behind the Candelabra "" starring Michael Douglas and Matt Damon "	1	2	1
"The memorial also included the song ""While I Still Have the Time "" which is part of the new musical based on the Jerry Lewis film ""The Nutty Professor"" that debuted in Tennessee this summer "	1	2	1
Stryker expands recall of Neptune waste management system	1	1	2
(Reuters) - Stryker Corp said on Tuesday it expanded the recall of its Neptune waste management product line to include later versions because U S  health authorities have advised the company that these devices do not have proper regulatory clearance 	1	1	2
In June  the company issued a Class 1 recall  the most serious type  of its Neptune waste system after receiving two reports of serious injury and a fatality resulting from the use of the product 	1	1	3
The company also notified customers that it was recalling the instructions for use because they did not specifically warn against connecting the high vacuum/high flow device to a passive drainage tube 	1	1	1
In a press release  Stryker  a maker of hospital beds and orthopedic implants  said the U S  Food and Drug Administration is unable to determine whether these last-generation devices are as safe and effective as their legally marketed predecessor  the Neptune 1 	1	1	2

Sweeping new changes expected at NKorean farms	3	2	1
SARIWON  North Korea (AP) — North Korean farmers who have long been required to turn most of their crops over to the state may instead be allowed to keep their surplus food to sell or barter in what could be the most significant economic change enacted by young leader Kim Jong Un since he came to power nine months ago 	3	3	1
The proposed directive appears aimed at boosting productivity at collective farms that have struggled for decades to provide for the country's 24 million people 	2	2	1
By giving farmers such an incentive to grow more food  North Korea could be starting down the same path as China when it first began experimenting with a market-based economy 	3	2	1
Two workers at a farm south of Pyongyang told The Associated Press about the new rules on Sunday  saying they were informed of the proposed changes during meetings last month and that they should take effect with this year's upcoming fall harvest 	1	1	1
The Ministry of Agriculture has not announced the changes  some of which have been widely rumored abroad but never previously made public outside North Korea's farms 	2	1	1
Farmers currently must turn everything over to the state beyond what they are allowed to keep for their families 	2	1	2
Under the new rules  they would be able to keep any surplus after they have fulfilled state-mandated quotas — improving morale and giving farmers more of a chance to manage their plots and use the crops as a commodity 	3	2	1
We expect a good harvest this year  said O Yong Ae  who works at Migok Cooperative Farm in South Hwanghae Province  in southwestern North Korea  among the region's largest and most productive farms 	1	2	1
I'm happy because we can keep the crops we worked so hard to grow 	1	2	1
The outside world has been watching closely to see how Kim's rule will differ from that of his autocratic father  Kim Jong Il  who died in December  and how he will deal with the country's chronic food shortages 	2	1	1
The proposed changes mimic central elements of China's rural reform in the late 1970s and early 1980s  when China allowed farmers to hold onto their surplus after meeting state quotas  said John Delury  an assistant professor at Yonsei University in South Korea who specializes in Chinese and North Korean affairs 	1	1	1
The result for China: a significant boost both for the economy and then-leader Deng Xiaoping's popularity 	3	2	1
Of course  a major difference between the two cases is that the vast majority of the Chinese population were farmers at the time  he said 	1	1	1
"North Korea has fewer farmers and less arable land  and ""will have to find its own formula for successful development """	1	1	1
Kim Jong Un  who inherited a nation with chronic food  fuel and power shortages  has made improving the economy a hallmark of his nascent rule 	3	2	1
The young leader  who is the third-generation of his family to lead North Korea since his grandfather founded the communist state in 1948  has already has made some significant changes 	2	2	1
He dismissed his father's army chief and promoted a younger general 	1	1	1
He has also been presenting a much more accessible public persona  appearing among the masses with his wife and giving televised speeches  something his father shunned during his time in power 	3	3	1
However  North Korea has maintained its confrontational stance toward much of the outside world  especially wartime enemies South Korea and the United States 	3	2	1
Pyongyang continues to build and develop its nuclear program despite outside pressure to dismantle its atomic facilities in exchange for much-needed aid and international cooperation 	1	1	1
North Korea has a per capita GDP of $1 800 per year  according to the U S  State Department  far below that of its neighbors in Northeast Asia  and its rocky  mountainous terrain and history of natural disasters has long challenged the Kim regime to provide enough food for all its people 	2	2	1
At collective farms across the country  the government doles out fuel  seeds and fertilizers  and farmers pay the government back for the supplies  said Kang Su Ik  a professor at Wonsan Agricultural University 	1	1	1
Under the previous system  each farmer could keep 360 kilos of corn or rice a year  in addition to what they grow in their own courtyards  and the rest was turned over to the state  he said 	1	2	1
O  who said her family expects a surplus this year  said they would likely donate it to the state anyway 	1	2	1
"Such a donation is known in North Korea as ""patriotic rice """	1	1	1
It's unclear whether the agricultural changes will be on the agenda when legislators convene Tuesday in Pyongyang for the Supreme People's Assembly 	1	1	1
The Presidium of the parliament did not announce an agenda  but Kim Song Chon  a Presidium official  told AP that legislators have been summoned to discuss domestic and foreign policy and to make personnel changes at top state bodies 	1	1	1
Swingers' hotel? German firm's expense claims laid bare	2	1	2

Swiss family involved in nuclear smuggling ring avoids jail	2	1	3
ZURICH (Reuters) - Three Swiss engineers guilty of involvement in a Pakistani nuclear smuggling ring avoided a prison sentence on Tuesday after agreeing a plea bargain with the Swiss Federal Prosecutor's Office 	1	2	4
Friedrich Tinner and his two sons  Marco and Urs  pleaded guilty at the federal criminal court in Bellinzona of supplying centrifuge parts and participating in the smuggling ring of Abdul Qadeer Khan  the former head of Pakistan's nuclear programme  who in 2004 was found by Pakistan to have sold nuclear secrets to North Korea  Iran and Libya 	1	2	3
However  after agreeing the plea bargain  the Tinner trio were handed relatively mild suspended jail sentences of between 24 and 50 months 	2	2	2
In a long testimony  Friedrich Tinner told the court on Monday about how he met A  Q  Khan in 1975 and used his business in the eastern city of St  Gallen to sell centrifuge parts for enriching uranium  the online edition of Swiss tabloid Blick reported 	2	1	3
The court also heard that Urs Tinner set up production sites in Dubai and Malaysia for producing centrifuge parts for enriching uranium  while Marco took care of supplies and book-keeping 	1	1	2
Swiss authorities started investigating Marco Tinner and his brother in 2004  confiscating thousands of documents 	1	2	3
A year later they expanded investigations to include Friedrich Tinner 	1	1	2
In 2009 Urs Tinner said that he had helped the U S  Central Intelligence Agency to uncover Libya's nuclear weapons programme by tipping it off that Libya was about to receive the equipment needed to make an atom bomb 	2	3	3
It was widely reported in the Swiss media that further investigations into the Tinners were halted after the CIA urged the Swiss government to drop them to avoid exposing the extent of the agency's activities 	2	2	2

Um Abdou's children are now buried in a plot of land in Syria owned by the state 	1	1	3
Her husband was buried in the cemetery in Jousi because it was too dangerous to take him back to his hometown 	1	1	4
Even the dead have no right to be buried  she says 	3	1	4
Um Abdou has undergone four operations in Lebanon  including the two amputations 	1	1	4
Her parents and sisters are looking after her  and she displays the green  red  white and black flag of the Syrian revolution in her room 	1	2	4
She knows the pain will be unbearable the day she goes back to Syria and visits the place where her family is buried 	2	1	5
In the meantime  she has written a poem in the hospital 	1	3	2
I lost my children and husband  but my soul is still strong  it reads 	3	3	4
BAGHDAD  Iraq — The gang of masked gunmen broke into the small apartment near Damascus where Waleed Mohammed Abdul-Wahid and his family had lived for nearly three years 	2	1	4
Are you Sunni or Shiite? they shouted  as his three children began to cry 	2	1	4
We are Sunnis!	2	1	1
Do you know any Shiites who are cooperating with the Syrian government? the gunmen demanded 	3	1	3
We do not know any such people  she said 	2	1	1
We are from Baghdad 	2	1	1
The brief but terrifying invasion sealed the decision Abdul-Wahid had been mulling for weeks: to leave behind an increasingly violent life in Syria and return to Iraq 	2	1	5
More than 2  200 000 people fled Iraq during the war and sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shiite Muslims  and almost half of them ended up in neighboring Syria 	1	1	4
Now Syria is plagued with the same sectarian conflict  and many of the same people are on the run a second time 	1	1	4
Abdul-Wahid had worked as a deliveryman back in Baghdad  bringing cylinders of cooking gas to both Shiite and Sunni neighborhoods 	1	2	1
His arms still show the burn scars 	1	1	3
The family packed up and fled to Syria  where they built a new life in a mostly Shiite suburb 	2	2	3
Abdul-Wahid  49  found a job in construction and started taking medication for the severe depression he had suffered after the kidnapping 	2	3	4
Then the uprising against Assad began  and violence returned to Abdul-Wahid's life 	2	1	4
Mortars bombarded their neighborhood  and snipers shot at people in the streets 	2	1	5
The last straw was the gunmen storming their home in late July  and asking his daughter if she was Sunni or Shiite 	2	1	3
Abdul-Wahid had to ask his brother for money  he says  his eyes filling up with tears of sadness and shame 	3	1	4
His family is living in a room in his brother's house 	1	2	2
I have lost everything now  he says 	3	1	4
"I am jobless and penniless   I am even afraid of going outside my brother's house	3	1	4
579 syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449 Now  I have to start from zero "	3	1	4
He plans to go back to Syria when — or if — the violence ebbs 	2	2	3
Wasan  his wife  says the shortages of electricity and water in Iraq are unbearable  as is the lack of good medical care  security and jobs 	3	1	4
But Abdul-Wahid is doubtful the violence will end any time soon  or Assad will be ousted from power 	3	1	3
I think that the armed struggle in Syria will continue for a long time  he says 	3	1	4
It is anger at being crowded with about 32 000 other people onto a parched  treeless strip of land  where the day is too hot and the night is too cold 	3	1	3
But it is also a murderous anger among the Sunni Muslims here against the Shiites back home  whom they blame for the war 	3	1	4
"When I return  I will kill any Shiite I see with my dagger	4	1	5
579 syrian-refugees-4-countries-talk-pain-fear-163621449 I will chop him to pieces  shouts Basel Baradan  a bitter 18-year-old farmer who fled the southern town of Daraa with his family in July "	4	1	5
He is weeping 	4	1	4
Jordan now hosts an estimated 200 000 Syrians  including those not registered with the U N  -- the largest number of refugees taken in by any neighboring country 	2	2	4
After months of delay  Jordan finally opened its first official refugee camp in July at Zaatari  near the border with Syria 	1	2	3
Already  about 30 000 refugees live at the camp  and they keep coming 	1	2	3
This poor desert nation says it can no longer afford to welcome Syrian refugees into its towns and houses 	2	1	3
So they live apart at Zaatari  and they grow angrier 	3	1	3
"Baradan's father Ghassan  50  also a farmer  says that with the ubiquitous dust  snakes  scorpions and swings in temperature  living at Zaatari is a ""worse struggle than Assad's missiles falling on our heads back home """	4	1	4
He too is angry  and blames Shiites under Assad for killing Sunnis 	4	1	4
Baradan lived most of his life exchanging visits and sharing meals with Shiite neighbors 	2	2	1
But he grew increasingly resentful in recent years because he thought the Shiites were getting more food and money  and were supported by Iran  a Shiite Muslim nation 	3	1	3
Sunni Muslims have no respect in Syria and we fled here to find ourselves confined to this dirty prison  he sighs  puffing on his cigarette under a once-white tent  yellowed from the desert sun and heat 	4	1	4
"Baradan's tent is marked with the Arabic scribbling ""Get out  Assad """	3	2	3
Outside  a group of young Syrians lines up to fill buckets with drinking water 	1	2	1
Shiites and Alawites are not Muslims  he says 	3	1	2
They should be killed because they are infidels  who are killing the Sunnis  the true believers and followers of Islam 	5	2	5
She cries as she cooks lunch on a small gas stove 	4	1	4
I never thought we would become refugees like them  says the woman  who calls herself Um Basel after her eldest son  in keeping with conservative Muslim tradition 	3	1	4
Her husband interrupts 	1	1	1
Even the Israelis do not treat the Palestinians the way Assad is treating Sunnis in Syria 	3	1	4
In a corner  Basel too is crying as he gazes at video on his cellphone of his 9-month-old nephew  Rabee  left behind in Daraa with his family 	3	1	4
CAIRO  Egypt — Syrian refugee Mohammad B 's passport expired a few weeks ago  making official what he has long known: He no longer has a country 	2	1	3
The 26-year-old had nowhere to renew his passport 	2	1	3
The Syrian embassy in Cairo was closed after protests 	1	1	2
The embassies in Libya and Tunisia had switched loyalty to the opposition and could no longer issue passports 	1	1	2
And the embassy in Algeria simply told him to go back to Syria 	2	1	3
That was not an option 	2	1	3
In Syria  Mohammad had been studying to become an English teacher 	1	2	1
The bullet pierced his upper lip  broke his teeth  ripped through his cheekbone and exited near his temple 	1	1	4
The deep  jagged wound identified him as an anti-government protester  which in Syria marked him for death 	1	1	5
At first all the protesters wanted was a new mayor and better amenities 	2	2	1
Mohammad was hopeful 	3	2	1
I didn't want to leave my country  I wanted it to get better  says the soft spoken young man with a ponytail and a right eye that droops slightly from his wound 	3	3	1
On April 25  the military clamped off the main road into Daraa 	1	1	2
A bullet sliced Mohammad's lip 	2	2	4
He waved his hands for help  and a car came to his aid 	2	2	4
A cellphone video he was shooting at the time  seen by The Associated Press  records the sound of a hail of bullets popping off the metal 	2	1	3
It was very painful  Mohammad recalls 	4	1	4
When he got home  his family fled to hide with relatives in the countryside 	1	1	3
He stayed in bed for a week  unable to eat 	1	1	3
Then he made the most difficult decision of his life: He had to leave Syria immediately 	2	1	4
Egypt does not share a border with Syria  and only about 1 700 Syrian refugees have registered there  according to the United Nations' refugee agency 	1	1	1
However  the agency estimates the real number is closer to 95 000 	2	1	1
Mohammad's family gave him about $1 000 in cash  all they could spare 	1	2	2
He put on dark sunglasses  wrapped a headdress over his face and prayed all the way to the airport 	3	1	3
The bus passed a gauntlet of 25 checkpoints 	2	1	2
At the airport  he was detained for questioning but slipped interrogators a $300 bribe 	2	1	3
He headed for his plane  sure he would be back 	2	1	3
Instead he is still in Cairo  with no money 	2	1	4
He lives in a rundown apartment where eight people share three rooms 	1	1	3
With the help of a German-based aid group  Mohammad has had four operations for his face 	1	3	2
His doctor says he will need more 	2	1	3
In February  one of Mohammad's five brothers made his way to Egypt  via Jordan 	1	1	2
Bashar  21  suffers from psychological problems after being shut in the house for a year watching the violence on TV 	2	1	3
His presence both helps and hurts Mohammad 	2	2	2
I feel like I have a family  but on the other hand  it made my life more difficult  Mohammad said 	3	2	2
He doesn't work 	2	1	2
But he is teaching Arabic and translating for journalists 	1	2	1
He also is considering starting a Web-based service to collect videos  photos and other documentation of the rebellion from citizens back home 	2	2	2
He talks with his family in Syria most days by phone or Skype 	2	2	1
They never discuss politics 	1	1	2
Since he left  security forces have gone to his house twice looking for him 	1	1	2
I am worried all the time about my family and friends  he says 	3	1	3
When I check on them  I just want to know they are still there 	3	1	3
Above all  Mohammad longs to go home  study and have a good career 	3	2	3
None of that is possible while he is stranded in Egypt with an expired passport 	2	1	3
I just want to stop this bloodbath  he says 	3	1	4
I don't know how 	3	1	3
Syrian warplanes bomb Aleppo  kill 3 children	1	1	5
BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian warplanes bombed two buildings on Monday in the northern city of Aleppo  killing at least five people including three children from the same family  activists said 	2	1	5
"Aleppo-based activist said Mohammed Saeed said the raid came before dawn  He added that the aim behind such strikes on residential areas is to ""terrify the people and try to turn them against the Free Syrian Army rebel group "	4	1	4
The fight for Aleppo  a city of 3 million that was once a bastion of support for President Bashar Assad  began in late July and is critical for both the regime and the opposition  If it falls to the opposition  it would be a major strategic victory in the civil war  giving fighters a stronghold in the north near the Turkish border  A rebel defeat  at the very least  would buy Assad more time 	3	3	3
Activists say nearly 30 000 people have already died in the uprising against Assad's rule that began 18 months ago  inspired by the other revolts around the Arab world against authoritarian rulers 	3	2	5
Fighting and shelling have been a daily occurrence in Aleppo  Syria's largest city and commercial capital  since late July when rebels attacked it and took over several neighborhoods  Repeated attacks by government troops to regain control of the areas have so far been unsuccessful 	2	1	3
The battle for Aleppo has marked the first time that the regime has used helicopters and warplanes regularly to strike from the air  bringing an even heavier toll of civilian casualties than before when military forces relied heavily on often indiscriminate artillery and tank shelling 	2	1	4
The Observatory said five people were killed in the latest airstrikes while the LCC said eight died  The LCC said the dead included three children from the same family  Rami Abdul-Rahman  who heads the Observatory  said the death toll could rise with more people feared buried under the rubble 	3	1	5
The Observatory said rebels and troops were fighting near the military air base of Tabaqah in the northern province of Raqqa  Last week  rebels captured a major border crossing with Turkey in Raqqa 	1	2	3
The latest attacks came as the U N 's top human rights body prepared to vote on a resolution next week that would condemn abuses in Syria  call for perpetrators to be held accountable and extend the mission of a U N  expert panel which has been collecting evidence of possible war crimes and crimes against humanity 	2	3	3
The draft resolution was submitted to the U N  Human Rights Council on Friday by Arab countries including Morocco  Jordan  Libya  Saudi Arabia  Tunisia and Kuwait  It is likely to receive a majority in the 47-nation council when it goes to a vote at the end of next week 	2	2	1
The Geneva-based council received a report earlier this month from the Commission of Inquiry it appointed to investigate abuses in Syria  The panel reported that an increasing number of 'foreign elements ' including Islamic militants  are now operating in Syria  The panel also submitted a confidential list of Syrian officials who it said could be prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity 	2	1	4
"Tablets  Turtles make ""most wanted"" holiday toy list"	3	2	1
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tablet computers  turtles and a new take on a furry old-timer are the hot toys retailers and manufacturers hope will spark a rebound from a dismal 2011 holiday season  according to a closely watched ""Most Wanted"" list released on Friday "	2	2	1
The industry is not just counting on best-selling toys to generate joy at the cash register  Major retailers are pushing more attractive layaway plans to lure shoppers into stores before they go elsewhere this holiday season 	2	3	1
Competition will be stiff over layaway: who's the earliest  with no fee or just a small fee 	2	1	2
"This year (there) is going to be more action early  and it's the battle of the layaway programs  said Jim Silver  editor in chief of TimetoPlay com  which released its ""Most Wanted List"" of toys on Friday "	3	1	1
Everybody is being super aggressive  announcing the hot items  saying 'come get it on layaway '	3	1	2
Walmart U S   Wal-Mart's largest unit  brought layaway back a month early this year - giving shoppers who live paycheck-to-paycheck more time to pay for holiday gifts 	1	3	1
Toys R Us Inc offered layaway with no upfront fee  and soon after  Walmart cut its upfront fee to $5 from $15  The $5 fee will be returned in the form of a Walmart gift card if all payments are completed on time - as the $15 fee would have been 	1	2	1
Among this year's hot toys is LeapFrog Enterprises Inc's $99 99 LeapPad 2 Explorer tablet  an update on last year's massive holiday hit 	3	2	1
The tablet made Time to Play's Holiday 2012 Most Wanted List  which is a hot read for toy industry executives  It was also featured on The Toy Insider  a holiday gift guide from a publisher that serves the toy and licensing industries  as well as gift lists from Walmart  Toys R Us and Sears Holdings Corp's Kmart 	1	2	1
Time to Play's list includes returning old classics like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles figures  a princess wedding castle playset for Hasbro Inc's My Little Pony  Lego Friends  and an update of Hasbro's furry 1990s toy  Furby 	1	1	1
Newer characters like Just Play's Doc McStuffins could be a hit  The doll based on the Disney Junior show has landed on lists from Time to Play  Toys R Us and Toy Insider 	2	2	1
"The consumer looks for value  Time to Play's Silver said  ""Parents look for things that a child will play with over and over """	2	2	1
Hasbro is looking for a better holiday season this year than the one last year  when demand weakened after Thanksgiving 	2	2	2
Larger rival Mattel saw international sales at holiday time hurt by a stronger dollar 	2	1	2
Toys R Us has introduced a program this year that lets shoppers reserve any 50 toys on a list it will draw up by making a 20 percent down payment in person at its stores by October 31 	1	1	1
Dollar General Corp said Thursday it is offering a 10 percent discount on purchases of at least $75 from its toy selection  which includes items by Mattel  Hasbro and Walt Disney Co 	1	2	1
Taliban release video on Afghan base attackers	1	1	3
KABUL  Afghanistan (AP) — The Taliban have released a video they say shows insurgents preparing for an attack on a NATO base earlier this month that killed two Marines and destroyed six fighter jets 	1	1	4
The footage released on Monday shows men wearing U S  Army uniforms as they practice cutting through a chain-link fence and charging through the opening 	1	1	2
One man indicates targets with a pointer and a whiteboard with drawings of planes 	1	1	3
He speaks Pashtun  a major language in southern Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan 	1	1	1
A Taliban spokesman emailed the link to the video to the media but it was not possible to verify the authenticity of the footage 	1	1	2
Nothing in the video indicates when or where it was filmed 	1	1	1
Tamer job gains expected for Canada in September	2	1	1
The gain of 10 000 jobs was the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 23 economists 	1	2	1
The most bullish forecast was for 28 000 new jobs and the most bearish was for a loss of 15 000 jobs 	3	2	2
If we look at the last six months  even the six-month average  which is about 27 000  that looks high for an economy that's growing at less than 2 percent  said Avery Shenfeld  chief economist at CIBC  who expects 10 000 new jobs 	2	2	2
So we're due for a somewhat slower pace 	3	1	2
The poll's median forecast for the unemployment rate in September was 7 3 percent  unchanged from August and July 	1	1	1
Jobs growth was muted in May and June after a whopping 140 500 new jobs were created in March and April  which was the biggest two-month spree of job creation in more than 30 years 	1	2	1
We expect a see-saw performance from the labor market in September as another strong gain in jobs (like that in August) is not likely given the current economic environment  IHS Global Insight Canadian economists Arlene Kish and Jillian Kohut wrote in a research note 	2	2	1
Canada has regained all the jobs it lost during the last recession  which was milder in Canada than it was in the United States 	1	2	1
Is Team Obama getting overconfident?	2	1	1
It's safe to say that the Democrats are pretty happy with where things stand in the presidential race  and that President Obama would rather be in his own electoral shoes than Republican challenger Mitt Romney's 	3	3	1
With a short six weeks left until the election  Romney's campaign is struggling to reboot after a disastrous few weeks  Obama holds a slim but steady lead in most national polls  his electoral-college advantage is even more formidable  and as New York Times stats whiz Nate Silver points out  history is in Obama's corner at this point in the race 	3	2	2
"Some Democrats are even declaring victory — ""Mitt Romney's not going to be president of the United States "" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif ) said Sept  16 "	2	2	1
I think everybody knows that 	3	1	1
Yikes! says Matt Miller at The Washington Post 	3	1	1
"Yes  Romney's had a ""week from hell "" but ""it's far too early for Democrats to pop open the champagne """	3	1	1
Team Obama has every reason to be confident: Could anything still happen in this race?	3	3	1
"A strong challenger might ""mount an unprecedented comeback against an incumbent "" but combine Romney's notable weakness as a candidate  Obama's just-under-50-percent poll numbers  and the fact that almost all voters have made up their minds  and ""a Romney victory just doesn't seem like it's in the cards """"Romney's"	3	2	2
"chances are in jeopardy"""	1	1	2
"Complacency is ""a special threat"" to Obama because his election strategy relies on a vast field operation  so if his politically attuned staffers believe the ""torrent of media coverage"" suggesting Romney is toast  there goes Obama's voter-registration and get-out-the-vote advantage ""Obama"	3	1	2
"campaign redoubling efforts amid fears of voter complacency"""	2	1	2
"One candidate is cocky  but it's not Obama: ""Republicans were — and are — right to see this as a winnable election "" says Jamelle Bouie at The American Prospect  but ""I'm increasingly convinced that the Romney campaign is beset by a clueless overconfidence """	3	2	1
"can Romney bounce back?"""	1	1	1
"Texas soldier dead after attempted ""scare"" hiccups cure"	1	1	2
KILLEEN  Texas (Reuters) - A Fort Hood soldier who shot dead a fellow soldier in an ill-fated attempt to cure him of the hiccups has been charged with manslaughter  authorities said on Wednesday 	3	1	3
The incident occurred when Private First Class Isaac Lawrence Young  22  came down with a case of the hiccups while the soldiers were watching a football game on television Sunday night in Killeen  Texas  home to the military post 	2	1	1
In an attempt to scare the hiccups out of his friend  Private First Class Patrick Edward Myers  27  pointed a handgun at Young and fired once  according to an arrest affidavit 	1	1	2
A bullet struck Young in his eye 	1	1	2
Myers said he thought he had loaded the gun with dummy rounds  according to police 	1	1	2
The soldiers had been drinking  police said 	1	1	1
Young later died in an ambulance  according to Killeen Police spokesperson Carroll Smith 	1	1	2
She said the investigation into the shooting was ongoing 	1	2	1
Myers was charged with manslaughter and is being held on $1 million bond 	1	1	2
Texas town's rental ban to get second hearing	2	1	2
Attorneys for Farmers Branch  Texas  as well as landlords and renters are scheduled to go before the 5th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday 	2	1	1
Farmers Branch was sued four years ago after it passed an ordinance allowing the city building inspector to evict any illegal immigrant renters 	1	1	2
A three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit ruled against the city in March 	1	1	2
The full court's decision to review the ruling is rare 	1	1	1
The appeals court has directed all sides to focus on the U S  Supreme Court's June ruling on Arizona's tough immigration law 	1	1	2
"It rejected major parts of the law  but upheld the so-called ""show me your papers"" requirement "	2	1	2
"Thai sailors go ""Gangnam Style"" on YouTube video"	2	1	1
"BANGKOK (AP) — The ""Gangnam Style"" craze has reached Thailand's navy  which is among the latest to mimic the globally popular dance video "	2	2	1
In a video posted to YouTube  a few dozen smiling sailors from the Third Naval Area Command perform the rodeo-style dance and other hip-shaking moves at their base on the popular tourist island of Phuket 	1	2	1
It was shown at the base's annual party Wednesday and posted to YouTube the next day 	1	1	1
The video shows white-uniformed sailors in sunglasses galloping through their offices and officers in scuba gear shimmying up the beach 	1	1	1
New Theory on Why Men Love Breasts	1	2	1
"Why do straight men devote so much headspace to those big  bulbous bags of fat drooping from women's chests? Scientists have never satisfactorily explained men's curious breast fixation  but now  a neuroscientist has struck upon an explanation that he says ""just makes a lot of sense """	2	2	1
Larry Young  a professor of psychiatry at Emory University who studies the neurological basis of complex social behaviors  thinks human evolution has harnessed an ancient neural circuit that originally evolved to strengthen the mother-infant bond during breast-feeding  and now uses this brain circuitry to strengthen the bond between couples as well  The result? Men  like babies  love breasts 	1	2	1
"When a woman's nipples are stimulated during breast-feeding  the neurochemical oxytocin  otherwise known as the ""love drug "" floods her brain  helping to focus her attention and affection on her baby  But research over the past few years has shown that in humans  this circuitry isn't reserved for exclusive use by infants "	1	2	1
Recent studies have found that nipple stimulation enhances sexual arousal in the great majority of women  and it activates the same brain areas as vaginal and clitoral stimulation  When a sexual partner touches  massages or nibbles a woman's breasts  Young said  this triggers the release of oxytocin in the woman's brain  just like what happens when a baby nurses  But in this context  the oxytocin focuses the woman's attention on her sexual partner  strengthening her desire to bond 	1	2	1
In other words  men can make themselves more desirable by stimulating a woman's breasts during foreplay and sex  Evolution has  in a sense  made men want to do this 	1	2	1
"Attraction to breasts ""is a brain organization effect that occurs in straight males when they go through puberty "" Young told Life's Little Mysteries  ""Evolution has selected for this brain organization in men that makes them attracted to the breasts in a sexual context  because the outcome is that it activates the female bonding circuit  making women feel more bonded with him  It's a behavior that males have evolved in order to stimulate the female's maternal bonding circuitry "" [Why Do Men Have Nipples?]"	1	2	1
"So  why did this evolutionary change happen in humans  and not in other breast-feeding mammals? Young thinks it's because we form monogamous relationships  whereas 97 percent of mammals do not  ""Secondly  it might have to do with the fact that we are upright and have face-to-face sex  which provides more opportunity for nipple stimulation during sex  In monogamous voles  for example  the nipples are hanging toward the ground and the voles mate from behind  so this didn't evolve "" he said  ""So  maybe the nature of our sexuality has allowed greater access to the breasts """	2	1	2
"Young said competing theories of men's breast fixation don't stand up to scrutiny  For example  the argument that men tend to select full-breasted women because they think these women's breast fat will make them better at nourishing babies falls short when one considers that ""sperm is cheap"" compared with eggs  and men don't need to be choosy "	2	2	1
"But Young's new theory will face scrutiny of its own  Commenting on the theory  Rutgers University anthropologist Fran Mascia-Lees  who has written extensively about the evolutionary role of breasts  said one concern is that not all men are attracted to them  ""Always important whenever evolutionary biologists suggest a universal reason for a behavior and emotion: how about the cultural differences?"" Mascia-Lees wrote in an email  In some African cultures  for example  women don't cover their breasts  and men don't seem to find them so  shall we say  titillating "	2	2	2
"Young says that just because breasts aren't covered in these cultures ""doesn't mean that massaging them and stimulating them is not part of the foreplay in these cultures  As of yet  there are not very many studies that look at [breast stimulation during foreplay] in an anthropological context "" he said "	2	2	1

Tom DeLay still waiting to learn legal fate	1	1	2
HOUSTON (AP) — Former U S  House Majority Leader Tom DeLay — still waiting to learn his legal fate since being convicted nearly two years ago for his role in a scheme to influence Texas elections — is praying for vindication but also preparing for the possibility of imprisonment 	2	2	2
"I don't like living under this cloud  But I'm not angry about it  I even pray for the prosecution and my enemies  the former Houston-area congressman told The Associated Press in an interview  ""No  they have not destroyed Tom DeLay as a person  And I'm ready to go to prison if that's where I'm supposed to end up """	1	2	2
But DeLay  and his attorney  Brian Wice  are hoping to get his convictions overturned  On Oct  10  they will finally get a chance to make their case to the 3rd Court of Appeals  arguing the once-powerful Republican leader did nothing wrong and is the victim of a political vendetta  a claim that prosecutors deny 	2	1	2
"Sitting with DeLay in his office in downtown Houston on Wednesday  Wice used a literary allusion to explain the case  He compared DeLay to Jean Valjean  the kind-hearted protagonist of Victor Hugo's ""Les Misérables "" He called Ronnie Earle  the now-retired Democratic Travis County District Attorney in Austin who charged the former lawmaker  a modern-day Inspector Javert  who pursued Valjean at all costs "	1	1	1
The Travis County District Attorney's Office says the case was never about politics but about someone who broke Texas law 	1	1	2
Our office has always been fair and never been politically motivated in prosecuting this defendant or any other  said prosecutor Holly Taylor 	1	2	1
Jurors in Austin determined DeLay conspired with two associates  John Colyandro and Jim Ellis  to use his Texas-based political action committee to send a check for $190 000 in corporate money to an arm of the Washington-based Republican National Committee  The RNC then sent the same amount to seven Texas House candidates  Under state law  corporate money cannot be given directly to political campaigns 	1	1	2
A judge in January 2011 sentenced DeLay to three years in prison but allowed him to remain free on bond pending his appeal  In June  Ellis was sentenced to four years' probation  Colyandro awaits trial 	1	1	2
"He has kept himself busy with speaking engagements and is involved with various projects that advance the conservative cause  including a religious-based one called ""40 Days to Save America "" He still lives in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land  an area he represented for 22 years "	1	2	1
"DeLay said people usually recognize him from his 2009 appearance on ABC's hit television show ""Dancing With the Stars """	1	2	1
DeLay and his attorney continue to contend money laundering did not occur because no illegal funds were funneled through the RNC 	1	2	2
Wice also said he'll tell the appeals court no crime occurred because in 2002 money laundering in Texas only applied to funds in the form of cash and not checks  The state law was later changed to also specify checks 	1	2	2
This was a situation where the prosecution couldn't sell the steak  so they sold the sizzle  Wice said 	1	1	2
"Taylor called Wice's claim ""rather absurd "" She said DeLay's belief that his case was politically motivated is just a way to ""try and explain away this legitimate prosecution """	1	1	2
While the various changes to the appeals court has resulted in a three-judge panel of two Republicans and one Democrat to hear DeLay's case  Wice said it won't give the ex-lawmaker an advantage 	1	1	2
"Cal Jillson  a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas  said there is some irony in DeLay — whose tough political tactics earned him the nickname ""the Hammer"" — claiming he is the victim of partisanship "	1	1	2
"If there is any irony here  it will be lost on Tom DeLay because when he looks out through his eyeballs he sees a partisan world  Jillson said  ""He sees everyone motivated the way he was motivated """	1	1	2
But DeLay says he is not claiming to be a victim  adding his faith in Jesus Christ has helped him through this difficult time 	1	2	2
I am totally at peace and I'm full of joy     I'm not beaten down  he said 	1	2	1
The state appeals court probably won't be the last stop  as the losing side will likely take the case to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals  Ultimately  the case could wind up in the U S  Supreme Court 	1	1	2
It's frustrating to wait so long to get justice in a case like this  said Craig McDonald  the director of Texans for Public Justice  a liberal watchdog group whose complaints helped lead to the investigation of DeLay's PAC 	1	1	2
I'd be surprised if he ever saw the inside of the big house  McDonald said 	1	1	2

Top 5 Strangest Meteorites You Can Buy	1	1	1
On Oct  14  pieces of asteroids  the moon and Mars that have landed on Earth go up for sale in a public auction in Manhattan 	1	1	1
These meteorites may have originated in space  but many create tantalizing tales — or hint at future calamity — when they collide with Earth 	2	1	2
From the more than 125 meteorite pieces and related material going up for sale at Heritage Auctions  here are five with the strangest space-rock stories 	2	1	1
On the evening of Oct  15  1972  farmhands in Trujillo  Venezuela  heard a sonic boom 	1	1	1
Years later  scientists confirmed the rock  which in the meantime had served as a doorstop  was a meteorite  according to the catalog description of New York City's Heritage Auctions for a partial slice of the Valera meteorite 	1	1	1
This is the only known meteorite responsible for a fatality  at least to date 	1	1	3
"It is going to happen  and it's going to be a very sad day	3	1	3
593 top-5-strangest-meteorites-buy-134343249 It is inevitable that people will be killed by a meteorite  said Darryl Pitt  the meteorite consultant for the auction "	2	1	3
He added that when he speaks to children  this is the first thing they ask about 	2	1	1
"He said he tells them to ""worry about the things they have control over """	2	1	2
The only asteroid tracked to Earth	1	1	1
The potential for a devastating impact from an asteroid or comet is real  and astronomers are keeping an eye out for this type of threat 	1	1	2
On Oct  6  2008  Richard Kowalski  at the Catalina Sky Survey  spotted a new asteroid  dubbed 2008 TC3  on a collision course with Earth 	1	1	2
For the first time  astronomers around the world tracked the asteroid's approach for the day before it hit Earth 	1	1	1
The asteroid exploded upon entering Earth's atmosphere  and as predicted  it fell in the Nubian Desert of Northern Sudan  where 35 pounds (15 9 kilograms) of meteorites were eventually found 	1	1	1
"It was renamed Almahata Sitta  Arabic for ""station six "" a railroad stop on the line to Khartoum near where the meteorites were found  according to the auction catalog description "	1	1	1
An 'accident' with a Chevy	1	1	1
Almost 20 years ago  on Oct  9  1992  video cameras at Friday night football games in the northeastern United States caught the fiery descent of a meteorite that would end its fall by punching through the trunk of a red Chevy Malibu parked in Peekskill  N Y 	1	1	2
The owner of the car  18-year-old Michelle Knapp  sold the car within a week for 25 times the $400 she paid for it when buying it from her grandmother  according to the catalog 	1	2	1
Chained to Earth	1	1	1
"In 1492  a stone fell from the sky outside the walled city of Ensisheim  located in the Alsatian region of France  preceded by ""a great thunder clap  then a long noise that was heard far around "" the auction catalog quotes a 16th-century document "	1	1	1
The stone's descent was seen as a sign from God  the extraterrestrial origin of meteorites would not be accepted for another 300 years 	2	1	2
On Aug  14  1992  residents of the Nigerian city of Mbale heard a loud explosion that became a rumbling  accompanied by a white smoke trail in the sky 	1	1	1
Then rocks rained down  pelting an area of about 1 9 by 4 3 miles (3 by 7 kilometers) 	2	1	2
Because the region was being ravaged by AIDS  Mbale residents believed the meteorite shower brought a cure from God  and they ground up the stones into a paste that was eaten or applied topically  the auction catalog recounts 	1	1	1
Within several months  426 stones weighting 238 pounds (108 kilograms) had been recovered from this large meteorite shower 	1	1	1
The auction  held by Heritage Auctions  is scheduled to take place on Sunday  Oct  14  at the Fletcher-Sinclair Mansion at 2 East 79th Street in Manhattan 	1	1	1

Toys R Us sued over kids tablet trade secrets	1	1	2
The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Diego  California  seeks to stop Toys R Us from selling Tabeo ahead of the all-important holiday season 	1	1	1
Nabi creator Fuhu Inc contends that Toys R Us agreed to become the exclusive seller of the Nabi last year to learn product secrets before bringing Tabeo to market 	2	1	2
The introduction of Tabeo heated up the market for tablets designed specifically for children  which also includes players like LeapFrog Enterprises Inc's LeapPad 	2	1	2
Fuhu accused Toys R Us of fraud  breach of contract  unfair competition and trade secret misappropriation 	2	1	3
"According to the lawsuit  Toys R Us agreed in October 2011 to become the exclusive Nabi distributor  but in the end did ""virtually no promotion"" and only ordered for the holiday season a little more than what Toys R Us said could be sold in one day "	2	1	2
The companies ended their exclusive agreement in January 	1	1	1
Fuhu said in the lawsuit that the reason for Toys R Us's behavior did not become clear until it introduced Tabeo this month 	2	1	2
Toys R Us used Fuhu's trade secrets and confidential information to start selling Tabeo  which systematically attempts to replicate the Nabi experience  far earlier than Toys r Us could have done otherwise  if at all  the lawsuit said 	3	1	2
Aside from the order to stop selling Tabeo  Fuhu is asking that any Tabeos be turned over to Fuhu 	2	1	2
It is also seeking unspecified monetary damages 	1	1	2
A spokeswoman for Toys R Us said the company could not comment on the lawsuit as it has yet to have an opportunity to review it 	2	1	1
"The case is Fuhu Inc v Toys ""R"" Us Inc  Case "	1	1	1
Trader Joe's recalls peanut butter	1	1	2
WASHINGTON (AP) — The grocery store chain Trader Joe's is recalling peanut butter that has been linked to 29 salmonella illnesses in 18 states 	1	1	3
The Food and Drug Administration and the federal Centers for Disease Control said Saturday that the store's Creamy Salted Valencia Peanut Butter  which is sold nationwide  is the likely source of the outbreak 	2	1	3
The agencies are investigating whether any other items sold at the store could be contaminated 	2	1	3
More than three-fourths of those who became ill were children under the age of 18 	2	1	3
No deaths have been reported 	2	1	2
The government did not release which states had reported illnesses  but several states have issued warnings to residents not to eat the peanut butter 	2	1	2
According to the individual states' health departments  three cases were in Massachusetts  one was in Rhode Island and one was in North Carolina 	2	1	2
The CDC said people became sick between June 11 and Sept  2  Information may not be available for those who were sickened after August 	2	1	3

Tullow Oil  partners start drilling third well in Kenya	1	1	1
NAIROBI (Reuters) - British explorer Tullow Oil Plc and its Canadian partner Africa Oil Corp started drilling a third well in Kenya  extending a campaign to discover more reserves after finding oil in the east African country earlier this year 	1	1	1
Drilling of the well  known as Paipai-1 and located in northern Kenya's Marsabit County  started on Saturday 	1	1	1
Its planned total depth is 4 112 metres and it could have as many as 121 million barrels of crude oil  Africa Oil said 	1	1	1
Tullow hopes the well will encounter oil  rather than gas 	2	1	1
A discovery at Paipai would extend the producing plays of Sudan into Kenya and open a potentially significant and new petroleum province within Kenya  Keith Hill  Africa Oil's chief executive  said in a statement 	2	1	1
East Africa has become a hotbed of exploration after several petroleum discoveries in the area pushed the region into the international limelight 	2	1	1
However  Kenya has yet to determine whether it has commercially viable quantities of hydrocarbons 	2	1	1
Paipai-1 on onshore Block 10A is a joint venture of Tullow  the well operator with 50 percent of the exploration license  Africa Oil  holding 30 percent  and London-listed Afren  with the remaining 20 percent 	1	1	1
Hill said the results of this well are expected before the end of October 	2	1	1
The British company also was a venture partner in the offshore well  Mbawa-1  that encountered gas 	1	1	1
However  Mbawa's operator Apache Corp said it had hoped to find oil and there was insufficient gas to justify costly investments in liquefied natural gas facilities and pipelines 	2	1	1
Kenya's energy minister Kiraitu Murungi said he thought the country had enough petroleum to warrant both projects 	2	1	1
Tullow indicated it would be at least a year before it knows whether its March discovery can be extracted and exported 	2	1	1
Turkey pro-Kurd party urges talks to end Kurdish conflict	1	2	1
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The head of Turkey's main Kurdish party has called for talks between the government and Kurdish militants to prevent a further escalation of violence which she said could undermine efforts to draw up a new  more liberal constitution 	2	3	1
More than 700 people have been killed since elections in June 2011  according to the International Crisis Group  the highest toll in a 15-month period since Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) chief Abdullah Ocalan was captured and jailed in 1999 	1	1	3
Last week  fighters from the PKK - labeled a terrorist group by Turkey  Washington and the European Union - ambushed a military convoy  killing 10 soldiers and wounding about 60 	2	1	3
Violence dominates now  from the Kurdish side and is also defining state policy  said Gultan Kisanak  co-chair of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) 	1	1	2
If fighting intensifies further  there's a high risk it will spill over into ethnic clashes as social tensions rise 	1	1	3
Let's return to the path of dialogue and negotiations and lessen the war  she told Reuters at the weekend 	1	2	1
The upsurge in violence coincides with efforts by Turkey's parliament to draft a more liberal constitution to replace a hardline charter drawn up after a 1980 military coup  and the government says it will include greater political freedoms for minorities 	1	3	1
Parliament reconvenes after summer recess on October 1 	1	2	1
Recognizing Kurdish identity and rights are fundamental to Turkey's effort to join the European Union 	2	1	1
It became a candidate for membership in 1999  but its drive has stalled over slow progress on human rights and arguments about Cyprus 	2	2	2
The Kurdish problem is about rights and freedom  it's a legal issue  and a solution requires a constitutional foundation  Kisanak said 	1	1	2
"We need to focus on policies for peace and establish a climate of peace	1	2	1
598 turkey-pro-kurd-party-urges-talks-end-kurdish-080458368 Otherwise it's insincere to work on a constitution while people are dying and blood is being spilled "	1	1	3
Some political analysts link the violence with the failure of secret peace talks  thought to have been held in 2010  in Oslo between intelligence officials and PKK negotiators 	2	1	2
The PKK took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984 in a campaign to carve out an ethnic homeland in mainly Kurdish southeastern Turkey 	1	1	2
More than 40 000 people  most of them Kurds  have died in the ensuing violence 	1	1	2
The rebels have scaled back their demands for more political autonomy for Turkey's estimated 15 million ethnic Kurds 	1	1	2
In the latest fighting  one soldier and three PKK fighters were killed late on Saturday after the rebels attacked two military outposts near the town of Tunceli 	1	1	3
More than a dozen people were hurt when an angry crowd stormed the BDP's local offices in the town of Bingol on Friday 	2	1	2
The BDP denies any outright connection with the guerrillas and has criticized some PKK attacks  but opponents say it has not distanced itself enough from the group 	1	1	1
Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey will halt its operations against the militants once they lay down arms 	1	2	1
Kisanak disagreed and said fighting with the PKK had flared before relations with erstwhile ally Syria soured 	1	1	2
There is a tendency in Turkey to continually look for excuses to blame domestic problems on the outside  she said 	1	1	2
Erdogan has signaled that some BDP lawmakers  including Kisanak  could lose their immunity to prosecution  granted to all members of parliament  after they were photographed last month embracing PKK fighters who had stopped their convoy on a road in the southeast 	1	1	2
Courts have banned most of the BDP's predecessors for links with the PKK  and pro-Kurdish parties were out of parliament between 1994 and 2007 	1	1	1
There is now a serious risk that parliament will debate our immunity  pushing Kurds outside of the political process  Kisanak said 	1	1	2
We need to keep the BDP  the Kurds  within politics to end the war and turn to dialogue and negotiations 	1	1	1
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish rescue workers retrieved an inflatable sex doll from the Black Sea after police were notified by panicked residents who mistook it for a woman's body floating offshore  Milliyet newspaper reported on Sunday 	2	2	2
Police cordoned off a wide stretch of beach in northern Samsun province and sent a team of divers into the water to rescue what appeared to be a drowning woman  it said 	3	2	1
The team quickly discovered it was in fact a blow-up doll  which they deflated before throwing in the garbage  the daily said 	2	1	2
It was not clear where the blow-up doll had came from 	1	1	1
The Black Sea is a key tourism destination for Turks and also sees busy international maritime shipping traffic 	1	1	1
TV show claims UK TV host Savile abused children	2	1	3
LONDON (AP) — For decades  Jimmy Savile was a fixture on British television — an eccentric  aggressively jocular host of children's shows and a tireless charity fundraiser 	3	3	1
When he died last year at 84 — by then knighted as Sir Jimmy — he drew tributes from Prince Charles and thousands of fans 	2	3	1
The allegations have set off ripples of shock — but not of surprise 	2	1	4
There had  colleagues said  long been rumors 	4	1	2
The main question being asked now is: Why did no one do anything?	2	1	2
Child protection advocates say the case fits a pattern seen in the response to the child-molesting Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky and in the English town of Rochdale  where a gang of men groomed vulnerable young girls for sex 	3	1	4
Authorities in both places have been criticized for failing to act on claims of abuse 	3	1	3
"The allegations against Savile are made in a documentary  ""Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile "" to be shown Wednesday on Britain's ITV channel "	3	1	2
The program alleges that Savile abused girls in his Rolls-Royce  in a mobile home and at BBC's television headquarters 	3	1	4
It includes interviews with a woman who says Savile sexually assaulted her while she was a student at the Duncroft special-needs school near London  and with a former BBC staff member who says she saw the entertainer indecently assaulting a 14-year-old girl 	3	1	4
"The BBC has conducted extensive searches of its files to establish whether there is any record of misconduct or allegations of misconduct by Sir Jimmy Savile during his time at the BBC	3	2	3
600 tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562 No such evidence has been found  it said in a statement "	2	2	1
Savile's family has condemned the vilification of a man who is not alive to defend himself 	2	1	2
The guy hasn't been dead for a year yet and they're bringing these stories out  said Savile's nephew Roger Foster 	3	1	3
"It could affect his legacy  his charity work  everything	3	1	3
600 tv-show-claims-uk-tv-host-savile-abused-133727562 I'm very sad and disgusted "	4	1	4
"Mark Williams-Thomas  who made the documentary  insisted it was right ""to tackle this highly sensitive subject and allow these women to have a voice — a voice that for many was not heard whilst they were children """	3	1	3
The former coal miner claimed to have organized Britain's first disco and to have been the first DJ to use two turntables — a claim that has frequently been disputed 	3	2	2
"For almost 20 years from 1975  Savile also made dreams come true on ""Jim'll Fix It "" a TV show in which he responded to children's letters by arranging for their wishes to be realized "	1	3	1
Savile championed a host of good causes  frequently running marathons to raise money 	1	4	1
He led work to collect millions for the creation of a national spinal injuries center at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in southern England and bequeathed money for a heart unit at Leeds infirmary named the Savile Institute 	1	3	1
His guarded private life was the subject of a much watched television documentary in 2000 by filmmaker Louis Theroux 	2	2	1
Part of his home in Leeds was a shrine to his late mother  whom he called The Duchess 	1	2	1
After her death in 1973  he spent five days alone with her body 	1	2	2
Music broadcaster Paul Gambaccini told ITV television that Savile had used his charity work to discourage newspaper stories about his private life 	3	2	3
"Gambaccini recalled Savile telling one journalist  ""'well you could run that story  but if you do there goes the funds that come in to Stoke Mandeville — do you want to be responsible for the drying up of the charity donations?'"	3	2	4
"And they backed down """	3	1	2
Surrey Police have acknowledged that they questioned Savile in 2007 over an allegation related to the Duncroft school 	2	1	2
The file was passed onto prosecutors  who declined to bring charges 	1	1	1
The Crown Prosecution Service is facing questions about its actions  as is the BBC  Savile's longtime employer 	1	1	2
"The BBC's ""Newsnight"" program worked on a piece on the abuse allegations late last year but decided not to broadcast it for what the BBC called ""editorial reasons """	2	2	2
"Chris Cloke  head of child protection awareness at the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children  said if any good came from the Savile saga it would be ""a better understanding of how cases like this have happened  a greater understanding that protecting children must be everybody's responsibility """	3	3	2
"There is a concern that children aren't listened to  he said  ""and that is something that has been around for a very long time """	3	2	2
Twitter CEO: Apple is our Mentor  Facebook our Opposite	1	1	1
"Twitter CEO Dick Costolo  fresh from a day of smartphone Twitter app releases  said Tuesday night that his company saw Apple as a ""mentor"" to Twitter "	3	1	1
Apple is in many ways a mentor company for us  Costolo told PBS interviewer Charlie Rose 	3	1	1
Facebook was pursuing symmetric networks  Costolo said  but Twitter saw the world as asymmetric 	2	1	1
They were fundamentally opposed  and competed for ad dollars 	2	1	2
He also spoke of Twitter needing to have control over its own user experience 	2	1	1
We'll see how it evolves  was Costolo's judgment of Android 	2	1	1
This year has seen Twitter abruptly shut off API access to an increasing number of companies 	2	1	1
It has also seen Twitter deeply integrate into Apple's Mountain Lion and iOS6 systems -- ahead of Facebook integration 	2	1	1
The interview gave us a lot of context on how Twitter sees itself  and what developers who depend on the company can expect 	3	1	1
Costolo clearly stated he wanted a large ecosystem (just as Apple has)  but hinted at one that was very strictly and centrally controlled (much like Apple's) 	3	1	1
What does this mean for the future of Twitter?	1	1	1
Will Apple become ever more integrated  and vice-versa?	1	1	1
Give us your predictions in the comments 	3	1	1
The new tool will allow users  including journalists  to manually curate and display tweets to accompany breaking news events 	1	1	1
We've known for a long time that for events in the real world  the shared experience is on Twitter  Costolo said at the Online News Association conference in San Francisco 	2	1	1
We want to create an ability to curate those events 	3	2	1
Costolo dismissed speculation that Twitter had plans to operate like a traditional media company  following a recent move to restrict access to tweets only through its website or official app 	1	1	1
Previously  many users could read tweets through third-party applications with extra features 	1	1	1
It's not about being a destination  Costolo said 	2	1	1

"The decision to tighten control over tweets came after the company realized it had invested significant resources in its service  but other companies were making money off of it without adding ""accretive value "" Costolo said "	2	2	2
Fake accounts may be created by spammers or impersonators 	2	1	2
But the company has promised to unlock Twitter's full interactive potential once it has regained control over how users access Twitter across desktop computers and mobile devices 	2	2	1
Soon  users will see tweet boxes  known as cards  include live features that will look nothing like the 140-character messages units that they evolved in the early days of the service 	2	1	1
We want to migrate to a world in which the 140 characters can serve as a caption for additional functionality  Costolo said 	2	1	1
We'd like that to include things like real-time data  even an application functionality 	2	1	1
One of the services available on third-party clients but not from Twitter itself - the ability for a user to download the full archive of his or her tweets - will be available by the end of the year  Costolo predicted 	2	1	1
In the hour-long talk  Costolo also revealed the scorching pace of expansion at his company 	2	1	1
Twitter  which relocated into new offices in central San Francisco in July  now boasts 1 300 employees  more than three times its headcount just 18 months 	1	1	1
"During an interview with CNBC on Wednesday  Costolo suggested that the company is considering ways to ""participate"" in transactions that take place on the social network "	2	2	1
“It’s particularly interesting in areas where you’ve got things like perishable inventory  like tickets ” Costolo told CNBC in response to a question about ways Twitter could potentially grow its business 	3	3	2
“We observe that and are paying attention to that  and are thinking about the kinds of ways we could participate in that value exchange ”	3	2	1
"At the AllThingsD media conference in January  Costolo shot down any plans to go this route by noting that  ""We don't feel like we need to add another component to the business """	2	2	2
In the time since then  Twitter has focused on building up its suite of advertising products -- Promoted Tweets  Promoted Trends and Promoted Accounts -- by rolling these features out to dozens more countries and giving advertisers additional tools to better target specific users 	2	3	1
These efforts appear to be paying off for the company  as it's expected to generate more than $1 billion in annual ad revenue by 2014 	2	3	1
Of course  just because ad revenue is growing doesn't mean Twitter should ignore other potential sources of revenue 	2	2	2
While Costolo didn't offer much in the way of detail in the CNBC interview about how Twitter might approach Ecommerce  he has suggested in the past that there's an opportunity for Twitter to make it easier for businesses to sell tickets and other limited-time items through tweets 	3	2	2
Twitter promoted limited-time discounts from retailers from an  EarlyBird account and earned revenue from the sales 	1	2	1
However  this effort was shut down after just a few months 	2	2	2
Twitter Goes Bonkers After NFL Game's Unbelievable Ending	2	1	1
A star San Francisco 49er's name trending worldwide thanks to an apparently fake Twitter account spewing vitriol 	1	1	1
Tidal waves of tweeted hate dumping on NFL commissioner Roger Goodell 	1	1	2
Fans flexing wit in snarky messages 	2	1	2
Players sharing uncharacteristically candid thoughts 	2	1	1
These were just a few of the ways in which the sports Twittersphere blew up as seldom seen on Monday following the Green Bay Packers loss to the Seattle Seahawks 	2	1	2
Twitter was so frothy because the game ended in seemingly unfathomable fashion and ignited long simmering tension between fans  players and the league about a labor standoff between the NFL and its regular officials' union 	2	1	2
The Packers lost to the Seahawks in Monday Night Football on a last-second hail-mary pass by Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson — a pass that was actually intercepted and let stand as a touchdown after the NFL’s replacement officials had what can only be described as a refereeing fiasco 	1	1	2
Initially  one ref signalled touchdown and another touchback  meaning he thought it was an interception 	1	1	1
After a review  the call (the one that was a touchdown) stood  and eventually the game ended 	1	1	1
Why were the refs replacements?	1	1	1
Immediately after the game  Twitter flew into a frenzy 	2	1	1
Twitter Thinks It May Know Your Friends	2	1	1
"Love the ""People You May Know"" feature on LinkedIn?"	3	2	1
Then you may be happy to learn that Twitter is essentially copying the feature 	3	3	1
Twitter already offers suggestions for who to follow  of course  and those have gotten more prominent (and relevant) on the site as the company has refined the widget 	2	1	1
It's based on an algorithm that has gotten better and more personalized  and now even takes into account your location 	2	1	1
People You May Know  however  gets populated differently 	2	1	1
"Twitter said in a blog post that the people suggested are based on ""signals"" such as who your friends follow and the contact information imported by the people you connect with on Twitter "	2	1	1
As an example  Twitter says if several people you follow also follow someone  that person could come up as a person you may know 	2	1	1
It's not clear exactly how imported contact info factors in  and we've asked Twitter for clarification 	2	1	1
In any case  Twitter users should begin to get suggestions via email in their next weekly update from the service 	1	1	1
Don't want them?	1	1	2
It's easy enough to turn off in your settings for email notifications 	2	1	1
"The new feature strikes us as a little redundant considering the existence of to ""Who to follow "" but we'll reserve final judgment until we see the updates for ourselves "	3	1	1
What say you?	1	1	1
"Do you think ""People You May Know"" is extraneous  helpful or whatevs?"	2	1	1

Suicide bombers kill at least six in Somali capital	1	1	4
MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Two suicide bombers walked into a restaurant in central Mogadishu and blew themselves killing at least six people  witnesses said  less than a week after militant bombers targeted the country's new president 	2	1	4
A Reuters photographer said he could see six bodies as well as the severed heads of the two bombers 	2	1	3
Chairs and tables were strewn across the restaurant and pools of blood covered the flooring 	2	1	4
The election of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud last week was hailed by his supporters as a vote for change in a country mired in conflict for more than two decades 	3	1	3
But the latest attacks underscore the security challenges the political newcomer faces as African forces battle to quash a five-year insurgency waged by the Islamist rebel group  al Shabaab 	2	1	2
"The restaurant  called ""The Village""  is owned by a well known Somali businessman who returned to Somalia from Britain recently "	1	1	1
U S  Ambassador Susan Rice: Twitter Crucial to Her Mission	1	1	1
How do you responsibly conduct foreign policy with a haiku?	1	1	1
"The United States Ambassador to the United Nations was a self-proclaimed ""skeptic"" of the power of social media "	1	1	1
I thought it might cheapen the coin  Rice said at this year's Social Good Summit while speaking with Mashable CEO Pete Cashmore 	3	1	1
"And most importantly  Rice felt that the immediacy and briefness of tweets forced her and her colleagues to ""distill messages to their very essence "" and forgo political doublespeak "	3	2	1
Now an avid Twitter user (as well as YouTube andFacebook)  Rice says she uses her following to establish causes and bring change 	2	2	1
"She even admits to calling out ""bad guys"" and dictators on Twitter for their reprehensible behavior "	2	1	2
Initiatives like Data gov  she says  have given power to the people in understanding how the government works and how it can be more innovative in problem-solving 	3	2	1
She also recalled the Syrian ambassador's effort to keep citizens informed by posting messages to Facebook about the location of Syrian tanks 	2	1	1
This type of real-time updating would have been impossible without social media  said Rice 	2	1	1
But Rice stays somewhat realistic about the ability for social media to mobilize people to a point of making government obsolete 	1	1	1
It's important to remember social media is a tool  not a solution  she said  adding social media provides limitations in space and remains inaccessible in certain areas of the world that need it most  such as Zimbabwe 	2	1	1
Cashmore agreed 	1	1	1
The tech itself is neutral  it's what you do with it that counts  he said 	3	1	1
"The government will remain a central ""part of the puzzle"" in the fight for change  Rice said "	2	1	1
She added that infrastructure  public education  and research and development are mainly responsibilities of the government  not of social media 	2	1	1
Has social media helped you feel more connected to global politics and issues?	1	1	1

U S  answers Florida cry to end tomato pact with Mexico	2	2	1
The decision surprised Mexican officials and tomato producers  who have offered to renegotiate the pact 	2	1	1
They argue the 1996 agreement has benefited U S  consumers and brought stability to the North American market 	3	3	1
Florida growers  who traditionally compete with Mexico for the U S  winter and early spring tomato market  have pressed the Obama administration since June to terminate the pact 	2	2	1
Many U S  agricultural and business groups weighed in favor of keeping the current pact out of fears the dispute could spark a tomato trade war that would have collateral damage on other commodities 	3	1	3
An end to the agreement would clear the way for U S  growers to seek anti-dumping duties that could lead to higher prices for Mexican tomatoes sold in the United States 	2	2	2
Mexican growers export about $1 9 billion worth of tomatoes to the United States 	1	1	1
"Francisco de Rosenzweig  a senior Mexican Economy Ministry official  said Mexico's government was ""very surprised"" by the decision  particularly as it came one day before a long-awaited meeting between Mexican growers and the Commerce Department "	3	1	2
"Martin Ley  a spokesman for Mexican producers  said they would put forth a ""strong proposal"" in the Friday meeting with U S  officials  which they still hope will lay the foundation for a new pact "	3	2	1
"Mexico's Economy Minister Bruno Ferrari told Reuters earlier this week it was ""obvious"" the Florida Tomato Exchange had timed its request to put political pressure on the White House ahead of the November 6 presidential election  he said "	2	2	1
Florida is one of several battleground states expected to determine the outcome of the Nov 6 election  where Obama is running against Republican challenger Mitt Romney 	1	1	1
The U S  Commerce Department stopped short of immediately tearing up the agreement  as Florida growers requested in June 	1	1	1
"The existing pact is called a ""suspension agreement"" because the Commerce Department suspended an anti-dumping investigation against Mexico in 1996 and negotiated a minimum price at which Mexican tomatoes can be sold in the United States "	2	2	2
Florida growers complain the agreement fails to protect them against Mexican tomatoes sold below the cost of production 	2	2	2
Ditching the agreement would allow Florida producers to file for new tariffs 	2	2	1
"U S  distributors of fresh produce sided with Mexico in the dispute  calling the notice of intent to terminate the agreement a ""slap in the face"" to the Mexicans and noting that thousands of jobs in border states rely on the tomato importing business "	3	1	3
The Fresh Produce Association of America accused Washington of acting hastily on political motives and said numerous U S  industry groups had lobbied to uphold the tomato agreement 	3	1	3
Even Walmart  the biggest retailer in the world  supported keeping the tomato suspension agreement  said Lance Jungmeyer  president of the group said 	3	1	3
U S  EPA probes possible crimes at Chevron's Calif  refinery: report	3	1	2
HOUSTON (Reuters) - The U S  Environmental Protection Agency is investigating possible criminal violations by Chevron Corp at its SanFrancisco Bay-area refinery in Richmond  California  according to a report by the San Francisco Chronicle 	1	1	2
Chevron told the newspaper that it was cooperating with the investigation  which began early this year  prior to the fire 	1	2	2
California pollution investigators have also been investigating the use of the 3-inch (7 6-centimeter) pipe  which allowed emissions from a hydrocracking complex to bypass the refinery's pollution control equipment on the way to the refinery's safety flare system  at the discretion of the complex's operator 	1	1	2
Chevron told the Chronicle the use of the pipe was inadvertent 	1	1	2
A Chevron representative was not immediately available on Sunday to discuss operations at the Richmond refinery 	1	1	2
U S  imposes sanctions on Japan's No 2 yakuza crime family	1	1	3
The financial penalties against the Sumiyoshi-Kai clan and its two leaders are the second time the Obama administration has tried to disrupt the yakuza's activities since it identified the Japanese group as a significant criminal organization 	1	1	3
In February  the Obama administration imposed similar sanctions on the most prominent yakuza crime family  the Yamaguchi-gumi  as well as its godfather and deputy godfather 	1	1	2
The U S  Treasury did not provide details on whether the yakuza has any assets under U S  jurisdiction or how the sanctions have undermined the Japanese crime group 	1	1	2
"U S -led ""war on drugs"" questioned at U N "	1	1	3
"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The presidents of Mexico  Colombia and Guatemala all called for a vigorous global debate of anti-narcotics laws at the United Nations on Wednesday  raising new questions about the wisdom of the four-decade-old  U S -led ""war on drugs """	1	2	3
Although none of the leaders explicitly called for narcotics to be legalized  they suggested at the U N  General Assembly that they would welcome wholesale changes to policies that have shown scant evidence of limiting drug flows while contributing to massive violence throughout Latin America 	3	2	5
It is our duty to determine - on an objective scientific basis - if we are doing the best we can or if there are better options to combat this scourge  Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said 	1	2	1
The speeches  which were a few hours apart  constituted some of the most public challenges to date of anti-drug policies that have been mostly unchanged since the 1970s 	1	1	2
Mexico and Colombia are two of Washington's firmest allies in Latin America and both work closely with U S  anti-drug efforts  While the subject of legalization was discussed at an Americas-wide summit in Colombia attended by U S  President Barack Obama earlier this year  raising the once-taboo subject at the 193-nation meeting in New York amounts to an escalation of the debate 	1	1	3
Obama has ruled out any major changes to drug laws  but some U S  diplomats privately concede that the consensus around Latin America is clearly swinging against the status quo  and that some degree of change is imminent 	1	1	1
We won't cede an inch to the gangs  Calderon said 	1	3	1
Calderon and Santos have suggested on other occasions that they might be open to legalization of narcotics if that helped reduce violence 	1	2	2
An influential group of former Latin American leaders including Brazilian ex-President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has openly advocated decriminalization of some drugs as a way to reduce violence 	1	2	2
The small  relatively prosperous South American nation of Uruguay has gone the furthest  sending a bill to Congress last month that would allow the state to grow and sell marijuana 	3	1	1
"In his comments on Wednesday  Santos described the debate over drug policy as ""a discussion that the world has avoided for many years  and one we hope will produce concrete results """	3	3	2
The debate on drugs must be frank  and without a doubt  global  Santos said 	1	1	1
U N  chief duped by prank call from fake Canadian PM	1	1	2
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A pair of Canadian radio comedians said on Thursday it took them less than an hour to get U N  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the phone during international diplomacy's busiest week - by pretending to be Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper 	1	1	1
"Ban was between meetings at the U N  General Assembly of world leaders on Wednesday when he took a phone call from Quebec comedy duo ""The Masked Avengers "" famous for tricking celebrities and politicians "	1	1	1
The pair said in a statement that the impersonator of the prime minister  who is known for his helmet-like coiffure  apologized to Ban for not being able to attend the U N  General Assembly meeting in New York because he was too busy combing his hair with super glue 	1	1	1
During the five-minute discussion  the pair also said they asked him to speak with National Hockey League Commissioner Gary Bettman to press for a Quebec City hockey team 	1	1	1
It was at this point in the conversation - which switched between English and French - they said Ban realized he was being pranked 	2	1	1
"Ban has more than 120 meetings with world leaders during the U N  General Assembly this week and his spokesman described the prank call as not ""the best use of his time """	1	1	2
The Secretary-General quickly understood that it was a prank  and he took it in the way that it was intended  as a joke  Ban's spokesman said 	1	2	1
It's a busy time of year  and the Secretary-General has a considerable amount to do  so it wasn't the best use of his time  but these things happen 	2	1	1
Their other victims have included U S  business tycoon Donald Trump  Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and rock stars Bono and Mick Jagger 	1	1	1
At the end of a rare fact-finding mission at the invitation of Moroccan authorities  Juan Mendez told reporters there was also evidence of torture being inflicted on people held in prisons and detention centers in the disputed Western Sahara  which Rabat controls 	3	1	3
"He said torture was not as common as it used to be during ""the past decades""  but noted his preliminary findings showed cases of ""credible reports"" of punches  application of electric shocks and cigarette burns "	3	2	3
A spokesperson for the official National Council of Human Rights (CNDH)  who attended Mendez' press conference  declined to comment on his findings 	2	1	1
Government spokesman Mustafa el-Khalfi could not immediately be reached for comment 	1	1	1
"The U N  investigator also denounced a rise in ""severe beatings  sexual violence and other forms of ill-treatment"" on undocumented migrants  many of whom flock from sub-Saharan Africa to Morocco in the hope of moving illegally into Europe "	3	1	4
CRIMINAL	1	1	2
"He urged Rabat to ratify ""as soon as possible"" the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture  known as Opcat  that aims to prevent mistreatment of people in detention "	2	2	3
Mendez will submit his findings and recommendations  coupled with the Moroccan government's responses  to the U N  Human Rights Council in Geneva in February 	2	1	1
Torture is a criminal offence in Morocco but no official has publicly stood trial for crimes involving torture 	1	1	2
"Mendez said Rabat may need to amend the definition of torture ""to bring the offence in line with international law"" "	3	2	3
U S  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said earlier this month Morocco  a staunch U S  ally in North Africa  could be a regional model after it managed to contain Arab Spring protests with reforms 	3	2	1
But she urged Rabat to reform the courts  make government more open and respect human rights 	3	2	3
Last week  U S -based Human Rights Watch (HRW) urged Morocco to investigate accusations police tortured pro-democracy activists to force false confessions 	2	2	3
U N  nuclear chief Amano to stand for another term	1	1	1
VIENNA (Reuters) - United Nations nuclear agency chief Yukiya Amano  a key figure in international diplomacy over Iran's disputed nuclear activity  will seek a new four-year term next year  the Vienna-based organization said on Wednesday 	2	1	1
Western diplomats say they expect Amano  who has taken a tougher approach on the Iran nuclear file than his predecessor Mohamed ElBaradei  to be reappointed without problems  in contrast to his close election victory in 2009 	1	1	2
"I don't expect anyone will challenge him  one European diplomat said  adding that Amano has been ""very firm"" on Iran "	3	1	1
The 35-nation governing board of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  which will decide on the issue by June next year  on Monday set a December 31 deadline for the nomination of candidates 	1	1	1
So far  Amano is the only confirmed candidate 	1	1	1
Under Amano  the IAEA was criticized last year for a perceived slow initial response to Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster and the agency's ties with Tehran have become increasingly strained 	1	1	2
However  Western diplomats are generally happy with the way Amano has stepped up pressure on Iran to make it stop stonewalling an agency investigation into suspected atom bomb research  even if that push has yet to bear fruit 	3	2	1
Iran denies Western allegations that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons capability 	2	1	2
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Patients stepping into Johns Hopkins University's HIV clinic in east Baltimore don't just see a doctor or get prescriptions for their antiretroviral drugs  many also get help finding a place to live or bus fare to make it to their next appointment 	2	1	1
Such care that goes beyond the examination table and into patients' often challenging lives has been key to helping poorer HIV patients - particularly blacks and women - live longer  healthier lives  according to a 15-year study published on Thursday in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases 	2	2	1
"Researchers at the university followed 6 366 patients in the mostly black  low-income part of a city marked by abandoned buildings and plagued by an illegal drug trade that drew national attention on the gritty television series ""The Wire """	1	2	1
From 1995 to 2010  doctors at Hopkins joined with social workers and other experts to treat HIV  the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDs  and address other aspects of care that can often derail patients  such as being able to fill prescriptions or access health insurance programs for the needy 	1	1	1
They found that with additional assistance  at-risk patients who contract the virus in their late 20s can expect to live to about age 73 despite their race  sex or drug use  compared with some earlier data that showed higher mortality rates among such groups 	2	1	2
Just like over time we have developed medications that are easier to take  have fewer toxicities and are more effective  I think we've done exactly the same things in our ability to deliver quality care to this particular population  Dr 	2	2	1
Richard Moore  the study's lead author  said in an interview 	1	1	1
Moore  a professor of infectious diseases and director of the university's clinic  said the program shows it is possible to counter the impact of economic disparities on healthcare 	2	2	1
Even though HIV medications have significantly improved since the virus emerged in the United States decades ago  accessing those medications  receiving consistent care and follow-up appointments for the chronic condition are key  he said 	2	2	1
HIV still hits certain populations harder than others  and rising infection rates among gay black men  for example  remain a major worry among public health experts 	1	1	2
IMPROVING OUTCOMES	1	2	1
Previous studies have shown that certain groups of HIV patients -- the poor  minorities  women and drug users -- tended to have worse outcomes and die earlier 	1	1	2
Moore found that more comprehensive care that addresses problems such as homelessness and a lack of reliable transportation can help an average 28-year-old with HIV live roughly 45 more years with no significantly higher risk of various infections or other complications 	1	2	1
Moore also credited the roughly $2 billion Ryan White CARE Act  the largest federal program solely aimed at paying for care for low-income HIV patients who are uninsured or have inadequate coverage 	2	2	1
The program  which President Barack Obama extended in 2009  is up for renewal next year 	1	1	1
HIV patients are lucky to have access to Ryan White funds  but others do not 	3	2	2
This is likely a fundamental reason why the poor and disadvantaged in the United States have health disparities that cause disproportionately worse clinical outcomes than those with means  Saag said in an editorial accompanying the study 	3	1	2
Over the years  Moore said he and his colleagues have learned what tends to work  and what doesn't  when it comes to their patients 	2	1	1
Moore  who has worked at the Hopkins clinic for 24 years  said patients are immediately connected to a case worker who sometimes starts counseling them even before their first appointment 	2	1	1
Other clinics have also started similar efforts in recent year  but this more comprehensive type of care is not yet available nationwide 	1	1	1
Medical care  particularly for a lot of people who aren't necessarily well-insured or living in a stable situation  you have to just as much deal with all that aspect of assisting them with their lives  Moore said 	3	1	1
I wish that wasn't the case 	4	1	2
U S  power firm Dynegy emerges from Chapter 11	1	2	2
(Reuters) - U S  power producer Dynegy Inc   which counts billionaire financier Carl Icahn among its shareholders  said on Monday it has emerged from Chapter 11  less than a month after winning court approval for its bankruptcy plan 	2	2	2
The Houston-based company said it will have about $800 million in liquidity in the form of cash and will have eliminated more than $4 billion in debt through the Chapter 11 process 	2	2	2
In exchange for the elimination of debt and other obligations  unsecured creditors will receive equity representing a 99 percent stake in the reorganized company and $200 million in cash 	2	2	2
As part of the reorganization  on September 30  Dynegy Holdings LLC merged with and into the parent company Dynegy Inc 	1	1	1
Dynegy Inc filed for bankruptcy in July while Dynegy Holdings filed for protection from creditors on November 7  burdened by costly power plant leases and amid a dispute over whether its parent had acted properly two months earlier in taking about $1 25 billion of its coal-powered plant assets 	2	1	3
Creditors of Dynegy Inc and its Dynegy Holdings LLC unit had voted overwhelmingly in favor of their joint bankruptcy reorganization plan 	2	2	3
But some units like Dynegy Northeast Generation Inc  Hudson Power LLC  Dynegy Danskammer LLC and Dynegy Roseton LLC did not emerge from bankruptcy and remain under Chapter 11 protection 	1	1	2
LONDON (Reuters) - A study of eunuchs in Korea's royal court has found men without testicles live longer 	1	2	1
Except for a few eunuchs  most lived outside the palace and spent time inside the palace only when they were on duty  Min told Reuters 	1	1	1
In contrast  the average lifespan of the kings  who spent their whole lives inside the palace  was just 47 years 	1	1	1
Previous studies have shown female mammals generally live longer than males  and one explanation is that testosterone weakens the immune system and can increase the chances of heart disease 	1	1	1
Scientists have also found that castration typically prolongs lifespan in animals but studies on people have been inconclusive 	1	1	1
While data on mentally ill  institutionalized men showed them living longer  the lifespan of castrato singers was not significantly different from their non-castrated counterparts 	1	1	1
The study was published in the journal Current Biology 	1	1	1
Ultrabooks Get Anorexic With Acer Aspire S7	3	1	3
The Acer Aspire S7 comes in two sizes  Sporting a full HD (1 920 x 1 080) display  the 13 3-inch version is just 2 86 pounds and 0 47 of an inch thick  It starts at $1 400 	1	1	1
"Many PC manufacturers stretch the concept of the Ultrabook -- an Intel Core-powered laptop that's ""ultra"" portable -- by pushing the upper limits of Intel's weight and thickness specs  With the Aspire S7  Acer is admirably doing the opposite  unveiling new 11- and 13-inch designs that are remarkably light and thin "	2	3	1
The Aspire S7 is one of the first Windows 8 machines from Acer  and it ships the same day of the launch  Oct  26  The 11 6-inch S7 weighs just 2 29 pounds and is 0 48 of an inch thick and the 13 3-inch model is 2 86 pounds and is even slightly thinner -- 0 47 inch  That makes the Aspire S7 even more of a featherweight laptop than even the MacBook Air 	2	2	1
"Did we mention the touch screen? Windows 8  of course  is tailored to be friendly to both touch and mouse-and-keyboard setups  and the S7 lets you do both  The special hinge on the S7 helps out  too: First  it lets the screen fold a full 180 degrees  laying flat with the keyboard  Second  it's a ""dual-torque"" design  meaning there's very little resistance when first unfolding it  but once you get to a typical usage angle the resistance builds up -- also helpful for touch "	1	3	1
In my brief hands-on with the Aspire S7  I was immediately struck by how light the two designs were  The glass lid looks amazing  though I'd be extra careful about putting it back in its case when not using it -- even with the Gorilla Glass exterior  The keyboard feels nice  although it has an unusual modification to the Caps Lock key (see the gallery) 	4	4	2
Unaware of pregnancy  British soldier has baby in Afghanistan	2	2	2
LONDON (Reuters) - A British soldier who did not realise she was pregnant has given birth to a baby boy at the Camp Bastion field hospital in Afghanistan 	3	2	2
"The Ministry of Defence (MOD) in London said mother and baby were in stable condition and a specialist ""Paediatric Retrieval Team"" would fly out from Britain to care for them during the long flight home "	2	3	1
619 unaware-pregnancy-british-soldier-baby-afghanistan-080959721 In this instance  the MOD was unaware of her pregnancy  the ministry said "	2	2	2
The Daily Mail newspaper  which first reported on the birth  said the woman herself was unaware of the pregnancy 	3	1	2
The Mail said the Royal Artillery gunner had conceived before her six-month stint in Afghanistan began 	2	1	1
Her job in the field involved providing covering fire for troops fighting insurgents 	1	2	3
She was taken to the field hospital after complaining of stomach pains and was informed by doctors that she was about to give birth  the Mail said  citing military sources 	3	1	3
I am pleased to report the mother and baby are doing well and we are all delighted at the outcome 	2	3	1
Unfazed by deadline  Akin vows to fight on in Missouri Senate race	2	3	1
"That's not going to happen  the Missouri congressman told Reuters after a rally Friday afternoon at the state Capitol  ""The primary voters of Missouri gave me a job to do  That job is to beat (Democratic incumbent) Claire McCaskill """	1	1	1
"Akin was pilloried last month when he said in a television interview that women's bodies have natural biological defenses against pregnancy following ""legitimate rape """	4	2	2
The Republican party turned on Akin  including its presidential nominee Mitt Romney  who said Akin should step aside  Powerhouse conservative groups American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS pulled funding from Missouri  as did the National Republican Senatorial Committee 	1	1	3
What Republicans had seen as a likely win in a conservative state in their quest to seize control of the U S  Senate became an uphill battle  Akin had led polls before the gaffe but a recent poll has McCaskill ahead by 6 percentage points 	2	1	4
If I had to put money on it  I'd bet on a small victory for McCaskill  said Marvin Overby  a politics professor at the University of Missouri at Columbia 	2	3	1
With six weeks until the November 6 election there is still time for something dramatic to happen in this race  Overby said 	1	1	2
Akin could still leave the race if he files a court petition to do so by this Tuesday  But few believe he will 	1	1	2
Akin has several things going for him  He has grassroots conservative support  the former Speaker of the U S  House of Representatives Newt Gingrich is campaigning for him  and Tea Party king-maker and South Carolina U S  Senator Jim DeMint says he may offer funds to Akin 	1	3	1
"But he faces a well-funded opponent in McCaskill  who describes Akin as ""on the far right"" and herself as a bipartisan centrist in a bid for the moderate voters they both need "	1	1	3
Those passions prompted by the comments were on display at the Friday rally organized by Missouri Women Standing With Todd Akin  which was attended by around 100 supporters 	1	1	1
"A few dozen protesters gathered across the road from the state Capitol and chanted ""rape is rape """	1	1	4
"I am shocked there are women who would stand against their own interests by supporting Todd Akin  said Courtney Cole  sporting a ""rape is rape"" badge and holding a sign saying ""women's rights are human rights """	3	1	4
"I honestly don't know why people found Todd Akin's (rape) comments so offensive  Howerton said  ""I asked my husband and he said he didn't find them offensive either """	2	2	3
"Almost all of the speakers at the rally focused on abortion  Stacey Shore  ""a mom  a wife and a proud Christian "" said ""they can call it (abortion) a choice  but the truth is  it's murder """	1	1	4
"We are not a moderate state  Shore said  ""We are a conservative state and we stand by our Christian values """	1	2	1
Akin himself seemed relaxed  taking the microphone from the lectern and strolling in front of a statue of Thomas Jefferson 	1	1	1
"Afterward  he said he expects Republicans donors ""to take a look at this race"" if it remains competitive  ""Republicans are going to have to ask  'Are we just going to ignore the fact that this is a race we can win?'"" Akin said "	1	2	2
Political scientists note that Akin won the August 7 Missouri primary despite being outspent three to one  so he is no stranger to uphill battles 	3	3	2
According to the most recent regulatory filings  as of mid-July McCaskill has raised $10 3 million to Akin's $2 3 million - which he spent in the primary 	1	1	1
"McCaskill touts bipartisan compromise to win over moderates  In one television ad called ""Fifty "" she boasts of a National Journal 2012 ranking of senators from liberal to conservative that places her right in the middle "	2	1	2
I work across the aisle and I don't think compromise is a dirty word  McCaskill says in the commercial 	3	2	2
"Kay Henderson  a sales representative in the St  Louis area  describes herself as a moderate voter who ""almost never"" votes for Democrats and says she likes the McCaskill commercial "	2	2	2
"I see myself as a moderate and that ad really speaks to me  she said  ""I don't know if it will make me vote for McCaskill  but I'm tired of extremes and want the folks in Washington to work together and get things done "" (Reporting By Nick Carey  Editing by Greg McCune and Philip Barbara)"	2	2	2
Union-buster Walker calls for return of union refs	4	1	2
MADISON  Wis 	1	1	1
(AP) — If there's one thing that can unite political foes in Wisconsin  it just may be the Green Bay Packers 	3	2	1
Republican Gov  Scott Walker  who made a national name for himself by going after public employee unions last year  posted a message on Twitter calling for the return of the NFL's locked-out unionized officials after a disputed call led to a Seattle Seahawks 14-12 victory over the Packers on Monday night 	2	1	2
"Democratic state Sen  Jon Erpenbach  who was one of 14 Democrats who fled to Illinois for three weeks last year in opposition to Walker's union proposal  said he saw the irony in Walker's post but in Wisconsin ""we're all fans  first and foremost """	2	1	1
If you were born and raised in Wisconsin  you were raised on the Packers  Erpenbach said 	2	1	1
Every Sunday it's Packers and pancakes  not necessarily in that order 	1	1	1
The league has been using replacement officials  and through three weeks of the regular season there has been much criticism over the way some games are being handled 	1	1	2
Walker's spokesman Cullen Werwie tried to spin the governor's post on Tuesday  saying it wasn't meant as a pro-union political statement 	2	1	1
Walker's tweet was being widely mocked on Twitter in light of his push last year that effectively ended collective bargaining for teachers  nurses and most other public workers 	2	1	3
I don't think this anything to do with unions  but has everything to do with refs making bad calls  Werwie said 	2	1	2
Erpenbach was so incensed over the game that around midnight Monday night he tweeted two different public phone numbers for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and urged people to call and voice their displeasure 	3	1	2
I could never ref an NFL football game  ever  Erpenbach said 	2	1	1
"The replacement refs are doing the best they can do out there  but the commissioner doesn't want this to sink to a World Wrestling Federation-type event on Sunday	2	1	2

621 union-buster-walker-calls-return-union-refs-142710047--spt It calls into question the integrity of the game "	2	1	2
While Erpenbach himself plans to leave a message for Goodell urging an end to the referee labor dispute  he won't be advising the Packers to employ the same tactics he and the other Democratic senators did last year 	1	1	1
Unique hometown advantage for Donald at Medinah	2	2	1
MEDINAH  Illinois (Reuters) - Much is made of home advantage at Ryder Cups and Britain's Luke Donald finds himself in the unusual position of being the only 'local' player on either team at Medinah Country Club this week 	2	2	1
The English former world number one spent four years at the nearby Northwestern University  married a Chicago girl and has lived in the 'Windy City' ever since 	1	2	1
It's a unique situation for me  Donald told reporters on Wednesday 	3	1	1
"I make my home here  25 miles just north of here	2	2	1
622 unique-hometown-advantage-donald-medinah-173015559--golf I've been living here for 15 years	2	1	1
622 unique-hometown-advantage-donald-medinah-173015559--golf I'll be the only guy on both teams that is more familiar with this town than probably anyone	3	2	1
622 unique-hometown-advantage-donald-medinah-173015559--golf Hopefully I can garner a little bit of the support from the crowd because of that and turn that into a slight advantage for Team Europe  but it certainly is a unique experience for me """	3	3	1
I always consider myself British through and through  he smiled 	3	2	1
"I've obviously reaped the benefits of going through the college system over here  that really helped me with my golf  and I enjoy living here	3	3	1
622 unique-hometown-advantage-donald-medinah-173015559--golf I feel very comfortable here  but I don't think that changes how you feel about where you grew up "	3	2	1
I still have a very close relationship with my country 	3	2	1
"I still have a lot of family that are there and I visit there regularly """	3	2	1
Since making his home base in Chicago  Donald has become an ardent supporter of Major League Baseball's Chicago Cubs and he feels the city's sports fans will give the Ryder Cup a raucous but respectful atmosphere over the three-day competition 	1	2	1
The thing that appeals to me about Chicago is that the people are very friendly  he said 	3	2	1
"They are very much into their sports and they get into it and they get raucous and they get loud	3	2	1
622 unique-hometown-advantage-donald-medinah-173015559--golf From what I've seen  they are respectful fans  and they certainly enjoy it "	3	2	1
They get up for it 	2	1	1
"But I think they will do it in a good spirit """	3	2	1
I have played here a couple of times in the last few weeks  just to get a feel for the golf course  said the 34-year-old Englishman who has built an impressive 8-2-1 Ryder Cup record 	2	2	1
"The golf course is pretty much in front of you 	2	1	1
622 unique-hometown-advantage-donald-medinah-173015559--golf There are not too many tricks to it "	2	1	1
It's about looking at the greens and figuring out where to put the ball in the right positions  because the greens are fast and slopey 	2	1	1
That's the key to this golf course if you want to make a lot of birdies is just putting it in the right place 	2	2	1
The Unraveling of Obama's Foreign Policy	2	2	1
Three days after Ambassador Chris Stevens was assassinated  Jay Carney told the White House press corps it had been the work of a flash mob inflamed by an insulting video about the Prophet Muhammad 	1	1	3
As the killers had arrived with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons  this story seemed noncredible on its face 	4	1	4
Yet two days later  U N  Ambassador Susan Rice doubled down 	1	1	2
Carney and Rice deceived us 	3	1	2
It is impossible to believe that Carney would characterize the Benghazi  Libya  massacre as the result of a protest that careened out of control unless he had been told to do so by the national security adviser  the White House chief of staff or President Barack Obama himself 	5	1	3
Who told Carney to say what he did?	1	1	1
Throwing a rope to Rice and Carney  the director of national intelligence  James Clapper  said last week that only recently had his team concluded that Benghazi was the work of terrorists 	4	2	2
Now that the cover story — that the murder of Stevens and the other Americans was the result of a spontaneous outburst the Obama administration could not have foreseen or prevented — has collapsed  the truth is tumbling out 	3	2	2
What do we now know?	2	1	1
Stevens believed he was on an al-Qaida hit list and so wrote in his diary 	1	1	2
He was concerned about a rise in Islamic extremism in the city 	1	1	3
Rice insisted that the act of barbarism arose out of a protest  but there may not even have been a protest  just a military assault with RPGs  machine guns and mortars that hit a safe house a mile from the consulate  killing two former Navy SEALs  while other U S  agents fled to the airport 	1	1	4
So dangerous is Benghazi  The New York Times reported Friday  FBI agents investigating the ambassador's assassination have yet to venture into the city 	1	1	2
This is the city U S  air power saved when Moammar Gadhafi's forces were closing in 	1	2	2
It now appears to be an al-Qaidaville where U S  diplomats and agents dare not tread 	2	1	2
Late last week  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton conceded that the Benghazi murders were acts of terror perpetrated by extremists associated with al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb 	1	1	2
She alluded to Mali  where an al-Qaida affiliate  the Ansar Dine  has taken over half the country 	1	1	2
How grave is that threat?	2	1	2
Al-Qaida affiliates have taken over a region of Mali the size of France 	1	1	2
Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb may have been in on the Benghazi massacre 	2	1	2
Al-Qaida has helped reignite sectarian war in Iraq 	1	1	2
Al-Qaida remains in Pakistan 	1	1	1
Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula is in Yemen 	1	1	1
We failed to cut out or kill the cancer at Tora Bora in 2001  and it has since metastasized and spread across North Africa  the Middle East and South Asia 	1	1	3
As for the Arab Spring Obama embraced  that has given us the Muslim Brotherhood in Cairo and jihadi in Sinai 	1	1	2
Our departure from Iraq paved the way to a new sectarian war 	1	1	2
The surge troops are out of Afghanistan  and the remaining U S  troops no longer partner with the Afghan soldiers who are to take over the war 	1	3	1
Within the past month  anti-American riots  flag burnings and the raising of Islamist banners atop U S  embassy facilities have occurred in too many countries and capitals to recite 	1	1	3
If this is the fruit of a successful engagement with the Islamic world  what would a debacle look like?	1	1	2
Is he wrong?	1	1	1

Unusual Dallas Earthquakes Linked to Fracking  Expert Says	1	1	1
Three unusual earthquakes that shook a suburb west of Dallas over the weekend appear to be connected to the past disposal of wastewater from local hydraulic fracturing operations  a geophysicist who has studied earthquakes in the region says 	1	1	2
Preliminary data from the U S  Geological Survey (USGS) show the first quake  a magnitude 3 4  hit at 11:05 p m  CDT on Saturday a few miles southeast of the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) International Airport 	1	1	1
It was followed 4 minutes later by a 3 1-magnitude aftershock that originated nearby 	1	1	1
The tremors set off a volley of 911 calls  according to Reuters  but no injuries have been reported 	2	2	1
Before a series of small quakes on Halloween 2008  the Dallas area had never recorded a magnitude-3 earthquake  said Cliff Frohlich  associate director and senior research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin's Institute for Geophysics 	1	1	1
USGS data show that  since then  it has felt at least one quake at or above a magnitude 3 every year except 2010 	1	1	1
"During hydraulic fracturing  or ""fracking "" millions of gallons of high-pressure  chemical-laden water are pumped into an underground geologic formation (the Barnett Shale  in the case of northern Texas) to free up oil "	1	1	1
That's dirty water you have to get rid of  said Frohlich 	3	1	2
One way people do that is to pump it back into the ground 	1	1	1
He found that all 24 of the earthquakes with the most reliably located epicenters originated within 2 miles (3 2 km) of one or more injection wells for wastewater disposal 	1	1	1
He explained that  though water is no longer being added  lingering pressure differences from wastewater injection could still be contributing to the lubrication of long-stuck faults 	3	1	2
"Faults are everywhere	3	1	2
624 unusual-dallas-earthquakes-linked-fracking-expert-says-181055288 A lot of them are stuck  but if you pump water in there  it reduces friction and the fault slips a little  Frohlich told Life's Little Mysteries "	2	1	1
Oliver Boyd  a USGS seismologist and an adjunct professor of geophysics at the University of Memphis  agrees that  in general  links between wastewater injection and seismic activity are plausible 	2	1	1
Most  if not all  geophysicists expect induced earthquakes to be more likely from wastewater injection rather than hydrofracking  Boyd wrote in an email to Life's Little Mysteries 	3	1	2
For past examples of likely human-induced earthquakes  Boyd points to the story of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal  a now-closed U S  Army chemical weapons manufacturing center that operated just outside of Denver until the early '90s 	2	1	1
In 1961  the Rocky Mountain Arsenal drilled a 12 000-foot-deep (3 658 meters) waste fluid disposal well near Denver 	1	1	1
"According to the USGS  ""an unusual series of earthquakes erupted in the area soon after """	3	1	2
Use of the well was discontinued in February 1966 	1	1	1
A year and a half later  on Aug  9  1967  a 5 3-magnitude earthquake  the most powerful in Denver's history  struck 	1	1	3
It was followed by a 5 2-magnitude quake in the region that November  according to the USGS 	1	1	1
US Fidelis president gets 8-year state prison term	1	1	2
ST  CHARLES  Mo  (AP) — The former president of US Fidelis has been sentenced to eight years in prison on state charges of stealing and fraud 	1	1	2
He was sentenced to eight years on federal charges on Sept 25  and the terms will be served concurrently 	1	1	2
The 47-year-old co-founded the auto service contract seller with his 42-year-old brother  Cory Atkinson 	1	1	1
The younger Atkinson is sentenced to four years on state charges and 40 months on federal charges  also to be served concurrently 	1	1	2
The Wentzville  Mo -based US Fidelis collapsed in 2009 and filed for bankruptcy in 2010 amid accusations of fraud 	1	1	2
Prosecutors say the company misled customers about warranty coverage and fraudulently withheld refunds 	1	2	1
They say the brothers used company funds to live lavish lifestyles 	1	1	2
US Military Wants Space Planes  Reusable Rockets	1	1	1
Reusable launch vehicles capable of soaring into space and returning by flying through Earth's atmosphere like airplanes could potentially save millions on expensive launches that typically cost thousands of dollars per pound — especially if they fly frequently 	2	2	1
But U S  military officers and researchers acknowledged the challenge of pushing for next-generation space vehicles during a time of budget cuts 	1	1	1
In the long term  we need full spectrum launch capability at dramatically lower cost 	2	1	2
The U S  government spent tens of millions of dollars on space plane programs in past decades — not to mention the $3 billion National Aero-Space Plane project — but most never got off the ground before cancellation 	2	1	2
Such half steps need to change if the U S  hopes to create a launch vehicle that can truly revolutionize launch costs  Air Force researchers said 	2	2	1
The reality is that if you're going to learn  you have to go out there and fly hardware  said Jess Sponable  a program manager at the Air Force Research Laboratory 	2	1	1
Making the dream real	1	2	1
The dream of space planes has often raced ahead of reality — original arguments for NASA's space shuttles envisioned flights once per week at a cost of just $20 million 	1	1	1
But the space shuttle program ended up flying just several times per year at a cost of about $1 6 billion per flight 	1	1	1
The Air Force's robotic space plane X-37B  a miniature version of the space shuttle  has flown two missions aimed at testing satellite technologies  rather than paving the way for cheap  reusable launch vehicles 	1	1	1
Like the retired space shuttle  X-37B launches aboard a rocket and flies back down to Earth after reentering the planet's atmosphere 	1	1	1
We've got to learn how to build and fly this class of system  Sponable said 	3	1	1
It's some strange  in-between hybrid that's not an aircraft and not a rocket 	2	1	1
The private space industry has also experimented with the space plane concept 	1	1	1
SpaceShipOne  a private suborbital space plane  won the $10 million Ansari X Prize in 2004 	1	2	1
But the air-launched vehicle and its SpaceShipTwo successor are more suited to carrying space tourists to the edge of space rather than lift heavy cargo 	1	1	1
Bringing rockets back	1	1	1
Perhaps the most promising reusable launch vehicle designs won't be space planes at all  but simply reusable rockets 	3	1	1
SpaceX  the firm founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk  has begun working on a reusable rocket concept called the Grasshopper that puts landing gear on a Falcon 9 rocket's core stage 	1	1	1
We emphasize we don't care if [a solution] has wings or no wings — we want maintenance to be minimal  Sponable said 	3	1	1
How you fly it and how it actually looks like is a secondary issue 	2	1	1
The Air Force Research Laboratory has also studied a reusable rocket concept under its Reusable Booster System (RBS) Pathfinderprogram 	1	1	1
"The ""rocket-back"" concept would involve the rocket firing its engines to reverse its climb and glide back down to an aircraft-style landing "	1	1	1
The next step would have involved a $55-75 million contract to build it  not including launch costs — but the Air Force decided to discontinue funding and shelve the project 	1	1	1
Driving down the launch cost	1	1	1
Program cancellations make the immediate future of space planes or reusable rockets seem uncertain 	2	1	2
The private space industry may end up paving the way during a time of less government spending — especially with companies such as Elon Musk's SpaceX working to drive down launch concepts through its conventional Falcon rockets and its more experimental Grasshopper concept 	1	1	1
Future space plane projects would do well to learn from the SpaceX example  Air Force researchers said 	2	1	1
We need to reconcile why Elon was able to do what he did with the money spent  on an order of magnitude lower cost than what models would have predicted  Sponable said 	3	1	1
Zweber  Sponable's Air Force Research Laboratory colleague  also gave the cautious thumbs up for the SpaceX approach 	2	2	1
I think we all wish them the best and hope they deliver on what they promise  Zweber said 	3	1	1
US State Dept  blasts CNN report on Stevens' diary	1	1	1
LOS ANGELES (AP) — A U S  State Department spokesman says CNN reported on the personal journal of slain American ambassador Christopher Stevens over objections from his family 	1	1	2
The news channel posted in a story online Saturday that it found a journal belonging to Stevens four days after he died in a Sept  11 attack on the U S  consulate in Benghazi  Libya 	1	1	3
State Department spokesman Philippe Reines says CNN broke a pledge to the late ambassador's family that it wouldn't report on the diary 	1	1	2
Reines is a senior adviser to U S  Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton 	1	1	1
CNN did not immediately return a call seeking comment 	1	1	1
USC Library acquires rare Hemingway selections	1	2	1
COLUMBIA  S C  (AP) — A love of Ernest Hemingway's writing and the thrill of tracking down his many works led a Mississippi physician to amass a huge literary collection and donate it to the University of South Carolina so students and scholars could share it  the doctor said Tuesday 	2	3	1
"It's like an Easter egg hunt	3	3	1
628 usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845 You just don't know what's going to pop up  Edgar Grissom said as he described his 50-year effort to compile all of Hemingway's English-language publications "	3	3	1
I have the most complete collection of his primary works in existence  said Grissom 	4	3	1
There's no equal to it 	4	3	1
The 70-year-old Grissom was joined by his wife Julie  46  at a special showing of the collection in the Ernest F  Hollings Special Collection Library on USC's Columbia campus 	2	2	1
Dozens of books in their original dust jackets  along with pamphlets  magazines  proofs and papers are on display in glass-covered cases 	2	2	1
Teachers will be able to access the collection to help students better understand Hemingway's creative writing process  university officials said 	3	2	1
"It provides a tremendous resource	3	4	1
628 usc-library-acquires-rare-hemingway-selections-211038845 It makes writing real in a very powerful way  said William Rivers  chairman of the university's English Department "	3	3	1
There is no other place in the world now where scholars can go to look at Hemingway's primary materials 	3	4	1
Grissom said his efforts began in his 20s as a medical student  and grew over the years 	2	2	1
Grissom said the collection includes more than 1 200 copies of novels and first editions as well as 2 500 additional items such as editor's proofs that few collectors even know exist 	2	2	1
Grissom said he and his wife were donating the collection to South Carolina because he was given encouragement and advice by several USC scholars over the years 	2	3	1
I could give you story after story of Hemingway scholars who told me to get lost  Grissom said 	3	2	2
They didn't think an amateur had any business doing this 	3	2	2
In particular  Grissom said he was advised by the late USC English professor Matthew Bruccoli  an F  Scott Fitzgerald scholar  as well as Patrick Scott  the former director of USC's Rare Books and Special Collections  and Elizabeth Suddeth  who took over Scott's post last year 	2	2	1
I had a special relationship with the University of South Carolina that I didn't have with anyone else  Grissom said 	3	3	1
University officials said the collection is so broad that it makes the school a top research center for the study of Hemingway because it includes some of the rarest of his published works 	3	4	1
"The collection includes many special items  such as a first edition of ""The Sun Also Rises "" the first and second editions of ""Three Stories and Ten Poems "" and three early printings of ""The Torrents of Spring """	2	3	1
"It also includes the first and second printings of the American edition  British edition and other scarce early editions of ""In Our Time """	2	2	1
USDA sets new release time for big agricultural reports	1	1	1
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U S  government plans to change the release time of major agricultural reports to midday  when commodity trading is in full swing  instead of current early morning releases when light trading volumes can exaggerate price moves  the Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday 	1	1	1
The new release times  which begin in January  affect the U S  crop report and five other major agricultural reports 	1	1	1
The shift to a noon release allows for the greatest liquidity in the markets  provides the greatest access to the reports during working hours in the United States  and continues equal access to data among all parties  said USDA Chief Economist Joe Glauber 	2	2	1
In May  the world's two major futures exchanges shifted to nearly 24-hour trading days 	1	1	1
As a result  USDA's most significant reports were being released when markets were open but trading volume was low 	1	1	1
The new release time  noon Eastern Time  will be the first change in release time of USDA reports since 1994 	1	1	1
With reports now being released while markets are open  a key issue is assuring speedy and equal access to the data 	1	1	1
USDA posts its reports on the Internet at the time of release as well as issuing them in print 	1	1	1
The new release time applies to the monthly crop report and its companion report on crops around the globe  the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates  the quarterly Grain Stocks report  issued in March  June  September and January  the Prospective Plantings report in March  the Acreage report in June and the Small Grains Summary in September 	1	1	1
USDA decided to continue to release three major livestock reports -- the monthly Cattle on Feed report  quarterly Hogs and Pigs report and periodic Cattle Inventory report -- in the mid afternoon 	1	1	1
Farm-sector and market groups generally favored the midday release when USDA polled them 	1	2	1
It was backed by CME Group Inc  the operator of the giant Chicago futures exchanges  the trade group Commodity Markets Council  and an array of major U S  farm groups 	1	1	1

Vanishing Electronics: Safer Medical Implants  Less Trash	1	3	1
Biodegradable electronics could one day be used in temporary implants that fight surgical infections or stimulate bone growth and then get absorbed by the body  researchers say 	1	3	2
They also suggest these short-lived circuits might one day find use in disposable consumer products to help reduce the environmental impact posed by discarded electronics 	1	2	1
The idea suggests a very different philosophy from today's business as usual 	2	1	1
Our thought was that maybe it'd be interesting to have integrated circuits that offer the performance of today's integrated circuits but have the opposite lifetime characteristic  Rogers told TechNewsDaily 	3	2	1
One of the most daunting challenges they face is biocompatibility — making sure any implants they put in do not irritate the body  or invite rejection 	1	1	3
"[9 Cyborg Enhancements Available Right Now] ""One way to avoid the problem entirely is to just develop materials that disappear completely "" Rogers said "	2	1	1
Over the course of three years  Rogers and his colleagues have created transient versions of all the components found in normal microchips 	1	1	1
These encapsulation layers are the first to dissolve  and the number of them can help dictate how long these electronics last — days  weeks  months  perhaps even years 	2	1	1
To test these materials  the researchers devised a biomedical implant that used heat to fight bacterial infections in surgical wounds in mice 	1	2	1
They also developed a fully transient 64-pixel digital camera 	1	1	1
Researchers envision vast opportunities for transient electronics 	1	2	1
You can imagine distributing them in the environment to monitor large-scale chemical spills  he said 	2	1	2
A third area that's a bit more challenging but equally interesting is consumer electronics  Rogers added 	3	2	1
"In the future  in addition to coming up with new applications for transient electronics  ""we'd like to figure out how to manufacture these things at low cost  high volume and with sophisticated functions "" Rogers said "	1	3	1
We want to leverage the manufacturing structures that already exist out there in the electronics industry 	1	1	1

ROME (Reuters) - The head of Italy's Left  Ecology and Freedom party is to run as a candidate in the primary to pick a centre-left candidate for prime minister in next year's national election 	1	2	2
Nichi Vendola  governor of the southern region of Puglia and Italy's only openly homosexual senior politician  has helped the SEL party carve a niche as a leftwing alternative to the main centre-left Democratic Party (PD) 	1	2	2
PD leader Pier Luigi Bersani and Matteo Renzi  the mayor of Florence  are the main candidates in the race to head a centre-left coalition  expected to take place at the end of November 	2	1	1
To drive out the fantasy of an encore for Monti and to transform the primaries from the umpteenth party feud into an opportunity for change in this country     I accept the challenge  to win it  Vendola said 	3	2	2
An opinion poll from SWG last week estimated Vendola's share of the ballot among likely voters in the centre-left primary as 7 percent  compared with 60 percent for Bersani and 30 percent for Renzi 	1	1	1
SEL's support in the overall electorate stood at 5 4 percent  the same poll found 	1	1	1
Venus and Bright Star Shine Together at Dawn Wednesday	1	2	1
Early-bird skywatchers on Wednesday (Oct  3) will be treated to a rather extraordinary sight  when the most brilliant planet passes exceptionally close to one of the brightest stars in the sky 	1	2	1
The planet is Venus and the star is Regulus in the constellation of Leo  the Lion  The celestial pair promises to dazzle observers before dawn on Wednesday  weather permitting 	1	2	1
"Venus is by far and away the brightest morning ""star"" and is currently the focal point of the eastern dawn sky  It will  in fact  remain this way all through the balance of the autumn season  Venus rises a bit more than three hours before sunrise — that’s even before the first light of dawn "	1	1	1
"At present  Venus glows just to the west (right) of the famous backwards question-mark pattern of stars known as the ""Sickle of Leo"" and is poised above and to the right of Leo's ""lucida"" – its brightest star – the bluish first magnitude star  Regulus  But because Venus is moving at just over a degree per day to the east  the space between them will rapidly close in the coming mornings  (Your closed fist held at arm's length covers about 10 degrees of the sky )"	1	1	1
On Wednesday morning  as viewed from the U S  East Coast  Venus will slide as little as 7 5 minutes of arc to the south of Regulus  To give you some idea of how small this is  it is only one-fourth the apparent width of a full moon or one-eighth of a degree 	1	1	1
By the time Venus and Regulus have risen for the West Coast  the gap separating the two will have widened to 12 minutes of arc  That’s equal to the separation between Mizar and Alcor  the double star that marks the bend in the handle of the Big Dipper  Astronomy guides often state that if you can spy Alcor next to the brighter Mizar without optical aid  that you have normal vision 	1	1	1
But seeing Regulus so close to Venus on Wednesday morning may be more of a challenge because of Venus' overpowering brilliance  Binoculars will no doubt prove to be a great assistance in viewing this  as Venus is now shining at magnitude -4 1  compared to bluish Regulus at magnitude +1 3 (the lower the number  the brighter the object)  Converting this 5 4-magnitude difference into a ratio  we find that Regulus — one of the 21 brightest stars in the sky — shines only 1/158th as bright as Venus!	1	2	1

Vertex ends work on one hepatitis C drug  continues another	1	2	2
(Reuters) - Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Tuesday it will discontinue development of an experimental drug to treat hepatitis C after it failed to show sufficient efficacy to warrant further study 	2	2	2
The company  which was developing the drug  known as ALS-2158  with partner Alios BioPharma Inc  said it will continue development of another hepatitis C drug  ALS-2200  after it showed promise in an early trial 	2	3	1
The company said it is planning one mid-stage  or Phase II  trial of ALS-2200 in combination with the drug ribavirin and one trial to evaluate ALS-2200 in combination with the company's existing drug Incivek 	2	2	1
Vertex acquired worldwide rights to ALS-2200 through a licensing agreement it signed with Alios in June 2011 	1	1	1
The drug is designed to inhibit the replication of the hepatitis C virus and the virus does not appear to become easily resistant to it  the company said 	2	2	2
After victory lap  Endeavor rolls to retirement	2	2	3
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Space shuttle Endeavour rocketed beyond Earth orbit 25 times 	1	2	1
Its 26th mission: A 12-mile commute through the streets of Los Angeles to its new retirement home in a museum 	1	1	3
With Endeavour permanently on the ground after a majestic aerial spin Friday around California  crews over the weekend will begin unbolting the shuttle from the 747 jumbo jet and putting it on a special flatbed trailer  a process that will take a few weeks 	1	3	3
A crowd recently packed a public meeting where concerns were raised about the loss of shade and greenery in their neighborhoods 	1	1	2
Museum officials have pledged to replant at least double the number of lost trees 	1	2	2
But Friday brought nothing but good feelings as the shuttle became California's biggest star  the people its paparazzi 	3	2	1
From the state Capitol to the Golden Gate Bridge to the Hollywood sign  massive crowds of spectators pointed their cellphones and cameras skyward as the shuttle  riding piggyback atop a 747 jumbo jet  buzzed past 	2	2	1
It's just a shame that the program has to end  but I'm so glad they came to the Bay area especially over the Golden Gate Bridge  she said 	3	2	2
Onward to Mars 	1	3	1
At the Hollywood & Highland Center  a shopping complex with a view of the Hollywood sign  revelers yelled and screamed 	2	1	1

"This is right up there	1	1	1
634 victory-lap-endeavor-rolls-retirement-083612464 It was pretty cool "	3	2	1
Endeavour rolled off the assembly line in the Mojave Desert in 1991 and a year later  rocketed to space 	1	3	1
It left Earth 25 times  logging 123 million miles 	1	2	1
Friday's high-flying tour was a homecoming of sorts 	3	2	1
After a nearly five-hour loop that took Endeavour over some of the state's most treasured landmarks  it turned for its final approach  coasting down the runway on the south side of the Los Angeles International Airport  where elected officials and VIPs gathered for an arrival ceremony 	2	1	1
As the jumbo jet taxied to the hangar  an American flag popped out of the jet's hatch 	1	1	1
Endeavour will stay at the airport for several weeks as crew prepare it for its 12-mile trek through city streets to the California Science Center  its new permanent home  where it will go on display Oct  30 	1	1	1
Before Endeavour was grounded for good  Californians were treated to an aerial farewell 	1	2	2
Endeavour took off from Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave desert Friday after an emotional cross-country ferry flight that made a special flyover of Tucson  Ariz   to honor its last commander  Mark Kelly  and his wife  former Arizona Rep  Gabrielle Giffords 	3	2	1
It circled the high desert that gave birth to the shuttle fleet before veering to Northern California 	1	1	1
After looping twice around the state Capitol  it swung over to the San Francisco Bay area and Silicon Valley and then headed down the coast  entering the Los Angeles air space over the Santa Monica Pier 	1	1	1
En route to LAX  it passed over a slew of tourist sites including Dodger Stadium  Disneyland and the Queen Mary 	1	1	1
The cost for shipping and handling Endeavour was estimated at $28 million  to be paid for by the science center 	1	1	1
NASA officials have said there was no extra charge to fly over Tucson because it was on the way 	1	2	1
Endeavor's carefully choreographed victory lap was by far the most elaborate of the surviving shuttle fleet 	3	2	1
Discovery is home at the Smithsonian Institution's hangar in Virginia after flying over the White House and National Mall 	1	1	1
I want him to experience it and give him the memory since it's the last one  Reynolds said 	3	2	2
As Endeavour approached LAX  other airplanes were forced to circle and wait 	1	1	1
Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Miami snapped pictures and shot video out their windows as the shuttle arrived 	1	1	1
This was a once-in-a-lifetime event  said pilot Doug Causey  who has been flying for 29 years 	3	2	1
That was a real treat to see something like that 	3	2	1

Vodafone says it will cost 500 million sterling to fix CWW	2	1	1
LONDON (Reuters) - Vodafone Group said it would cost about 500 million pounds ($807 million) to fix Cable & Wireless Worldwide (CWW) over the next four years but the payback by 2016 from the acquisition would be bigger than some analysts expected 	2	1	1
The mobile operator bought CWW for a total 1 31 billion pounds in July in a deal that doubled its business with British companies and provided it with UK and international networks to increase its capacity to manage data growth 	1	1	1
It said on Thursday that it expected the business to deliver cash flow synergies of 150-200 million pounds a year by March 2016  resulting in an operating free cash flow contribution for the group in that year of 250-300 million pounds 	2	1	1
Its first priority  however  was stabilising CWW  which had long suffered from under-investment in its networks and customer service  with roughly 60 percent of the money earmarked for integration to be spent in the first 18 months 	2	1	1
CWW's Chief Executive Nick Jeffery  who ran Vodafone's global enterprise division until July  said CWW's revenues would continue the downward trend of the last three years until 2014 	1	1	2
Longer term  however  the opportunity to provide combined telecom and IT services to companies - one of the main rationales for the deal - was better than Vodafone expected 	2	2	1
The deal also gives Vodafone a 20 000-kilometre fibre network  relieving pressure on its network as data traffic from demand for services like video and reducing its bill for renting fixed line capacity from third parties like BT 	2	2	1
CWW's 425 000-kilometre international network would also be used to handle part of Vodafone's international traffic  the company said 	2	1	1
The Cable & Wireless name will live on in Britain for another couple of years  Vodafone said  while it improved the group's reputation 	2	2	1
We need to fix some things before we're happy to put our logo above the front door  the company's UK Chief Executive Guy Lawrence said at an investor event 	2	1	1
Analysts at Espirito Santo Investment Bank said the cash flow target was ahead of their estimates  as was the synergy range of 150-200 million pounds - they had 160 million 	1	1	1
The disappointment will be the length of time that it takes for Vodafone to achieve these cash flow benefits - March 2016 is more than three and a half years after the deal completed  they said 	2	1	2
Shares in Vodafone were 0 3 percent lower at 176 9 pence by 1332 GMT 	1	1	1

Warner Bros  and Sky Complete Pay TV Deal in U K   Ireland	1	1	1
LOS ANGELES (TheWrap com)	1	1	1
"- Warner Bros  has signed a new television distribution deal with Sky  giving the provider comprehensive pay-TV rights to films like ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and ""Dark Shadows"" in the United Kingdom and Ireland "	1	1	1
Under the terms of the agreement  Sky Movies will be the first subscription service in the United Kingdom and Ireland to show Warner Bros  movies 	1	1	1
Sky subscribers will get access to new releases about six months after they have ended their run in theaters  the company said 	1	1	1

WHO: Watch closely for new virus related to SARS	2	1	1
LONDON (AP) — Global health officials have alerted doctors to be on the lookout for new cases of a virus related to SARS but said there was no sign the disease was behaving like the killer respiratory syndrome that killed hundreds in 2003 	2	1	5
Earlier this week  the World Health Organization announced the new coronavirus had been found in a critically ill Qatari man being treated in London as well as in a Saudi Arabian man who died several months earlier 	1	1	4
Genetic sequencing found the viruses in the two men to be nearly identical 	1	1	1
Gregory Hartl  a WHO spokesman  said Thursday the two might have been infected directly by animals and there was no indication of human to human spread 	2	1	2
SARS jumped to people from civet cats and then mutated into a form easily spread among humans 	1	1	2
Unlike SARS  the new virus also causes rapid kidney failure  a complication not usually seen in respiratory viruses 	1	1	3
Britain's Health Protection Agency said a small number of potential cases were being evaluated 	1	1	1
On Wednesday  Danish authorities ruled out a handful of cases in people who had recently been in Saudi Arabia and Qatar hospitalized with flu-like symptoms 	2	2	1
WHO also issued a case definition for the new virus to help doctors spot cases early 	1	1	1
Saudi officials said they were concerned that the next month's annual Muslim pilgrimage of Hajj could provide more opportunities for the virus to spread 	1	1	2

Westwood makes Poulter pay  eyes Americans next	1	1	2
MEDINAH  Illinois (Reuters) - Lee Westwood made team mate Ian Poulter empty his wallet after a practice-round beating and felt confident he could keep up the good form for Europe against the Americans at this week's Ryder Cup 	2	2	2
Westwood and Luke Donald thrashed fellow Britons Ian Poulter and Justin Rose on Tuesday on the Medinah course where the Ryder Cup opens Friday and the winning duo were a splendid 13 under while playing a best ball format 	2	2	2
"It was only a practice round on the first day  Westwood  who could not help but break into a smile  told reporters on Wednesday  ""I wouldn't read too much into it  We came out fast and we were just way too good for Ian and Justin  And they are a lot lighter this morning in their pockets """	2	2	2
Donald  who paired with Westwood two years ago at Celtic Manor to hammer Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker 6 & 5 in four-balls  said he enjoyed reuniting with Westwood 	1	2	1
"It's always pleasing when you're able to take cash out of Poulter's wallet  A few months fell out at the same time  but it was fun  Donald joked on Wednesday  ""We both played well  We certainly have a good chemistry between us """	1	2	2
Westwood struggled in Sunday's final round at the Tour Championship  finishing last in the 30-man field after a final-round 74  but was full of confidence after his practice play 	2	2	2
The Medinah Country Club course has been shorn clean of tangly rough to encourage big-hitting U S  players to lash out off the tee  but straight-driving Westwood said finding fairways was always an advantage 	1	2	2
I've played here pretty much all year  and I haven't seen a golf course that's had no rough and no rough around the greens  Westwood said about the tracks on the U S  tour 	1	1	2
"This is not a golf course that either team is particularly used to  and I can't see how it suits one team or the other to be perfectly honest	2	1	2
640 westwood-makes-poulter-pay-eyes-americans-next-213536049--golf I would say that the last time I played a golf course set up like this with no rough around the greens and no rough down the side of the fairways was The Belfry in 2002  and we set that up for ourselves """	2	1	2
"I think there's still a big advantage  It was certainly yesterday  he said  ""I felt there was a big advantage to hitting the fairways still "	1	2	1
The greens are not going to get any softer  They will firm up  It will be an advantage to hit fairways  Always is 	1	2	2
Why Doctors Should Trust Their Gut in Diagnosing Kids	3	2	1
Doctors who treat children see scores of kids with minor illnesses every day  but serious infections are rare 	1	2	2
"One way that to ensure that children with serious infections are treated quickly is for doctors to heed their ""gut feelings"" in assessing the children's behavior  according to a new study from Belgium "	1	2	1
The study showed that in two out of six cases where a child had a serious infection  but didn't have the clinical red-flag signs of one  the doctor had a gut feeling that something was wrong 	1	1	2
Gut feelings should not be ignored  but used in decision-making  the researchers wrote in their study  published Tuesday (Sept  25) in the journal BMJ 	2	1	1
"Dr  Robert Chun  an assistant professor at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin  said  ""You have to have what I call 'a healthy amount of paranoia '"	2	1	1
"You cannot miss something that could hurt them for their life """	1	1	2
Where gut feelings come from	1	1	1
Primary care physicians often see children with serious illnesses when their symptoms have yet to develop in measurable terms  according to the study 	1	1	2
Chun said that doctors with experience treating children know that those who are acting lethargic or tired  despite having normal lab results  are cause for concern 	1	1	2
Doctors were asked whether they had a gut feeling  beyond the child's symptoms  that the child was seriously ill 	1	1	3
It turned out that 21 of the children were admitted to the hospital with serious infections  such as pneumonia or meningitis 	1	1	3
But such feelings can also be wrong 	1	1	2
In the study  doctors had gut feelings in 44 cases where those feelings turned out to be a false alarm 	1	1	2
Chun said that number of false alarms is not a reason to ignore the case where gut feelings were correct 	1	1	1
No one remembers the kid that you suspected  that turned out to be fine  he said 	2	2	1
But every one remembers the things you didn't look into — those are the ones that haunt you 	2	1	2
They found that gut feelings were most likely to arise when a child had a history of convulsions 	1	1	2
Additionally  gut feelings were strongly influenced by parents' concerns about their child's illness 	1	1	2
"Chun said  ""When a child is lethargic  when the parents say  'this is unusual ' as a clinician  you need to have a enough humility to know that even those all the lab numbers are normal  you need to look closer  and be more anxious """	2	1	2
In fact  Chun recently treated a 5-year-old boy with a rare infection of necrotizing fasciitis (sometimes called flesh-eating bacteria)  and parental intuition played a role in the case 	1	1	2
Moms and dads know their kid  they know that something's not right  he said 	2	1	2
There's nothing scientific about this  he said  adding that a more objective way to diagnose rare infections would certainly be desirable 	2	2	1
Getting second opinions from colleagues can help 	1	2	1
Why investors still aren't sold on the iPhone 5: 4 theories	2	1	1
Apple has announced that it sold 5 million iPhone 5 units over the weekend  crushing the previous record of 4 million set by the iPhone 4S in 2011 	2	2	1
One would think Wall Street would embrace this news from the world's most valuable company  right?	4	2	1
Think again 	4	1	1
Investors aren't impressed by the sales figures  and Apple's shares have tumbled from their $700-plus price on Friday  bottoming out near $685 Monday 	2	1	2
Why aren't investors sold on the well-received  record-breaking handset?	2	1	2
1	1	1	1
Analysts expected much moreForecasters predicted bigger  better things for the iPhone 5  Apple analyst Gene Munster of Piper Jeffreys went on record with an estimate between 6 to 10 million  settling on a conservative 8 million after seeing long lines of eager fans on launch day 	2	1	1
"In fact  says Jay Yarow at Business Insider  ""Munster called 6 million a 'worst case scenario '"	2	1	2
"So  this is worse than a worst case scenario """	3	1	2
Wall Street is responding accordingly 	1	1	1
2  The pre-orders were misleadingOn Saturday  Apple announced that 2 million people had pre-ordered the iPhone 5  more than doubling pre-orders for the iPhone 4S 	1	1	2
"The encouraging early figures emboldened analysts to boost their predictions  except ""obviously  the weekend sales didn't follow the same pattern as the pre-orders "" says Yarow "	2	2	1
3  The iPhone 5 had more ground to coverSales of the iPhone 5 were only about one million units higher than opening weekend sales of the iPhone 4S  says Seth Flegerman at Mashable 	1	1	1
"But ""when you normalize the number of countries in which the phones were available over opening weekend "" says ASYMCO analyst Horace Dediu  the iPhone 5 sold at ""roughly the same rate as the iPhone 4S """	2	1	1
So even though it smashed the old record  the figures aren't nearly as impressive as they seem 	2	1	2
"4  Apple's buggy Maps App raises bigger concerns The release of such a ""flawed product"" like Apple Maps with iOS 6 would have worried former Apple CEO Steve Jobs  says Dan Radovsky at Daily Finance "	2	1	2
Not so  it seems  his successor Tim Cook 	3	1	1
"It was a ""strategic gamble on the part of Apple  to knowingly foist a poor product onto its loyal customer base"" just to rid its mobile products of Google's presence "	3	1	2
And when consumers suffer  that's bad news all around 	2	1	2
Why are seats coming loose on American Airlines' planes?	1	1	1
American Airlines passengers are pretty rattled    literally 	2	2	2
Over a span of three days  rows of seats have come loose on three of the airline's Boeing 757 jets — in mid-air 	2	1	2
The airline says it will inspect eight other 757s with similar seats to make sure they don't have problems 	1	2	2
Here  a brief guide:What happened on these planes?While the jets were in flight  a row of seats on each of the planes — one going from Vail  Colo   to Dallas  one from Boston to Miami  and another from New York to Miami — came loose and tipped over 	1	1	3
Two of the flights made emergency landings just to be safe 	1	2	2
Nobody was hurt in any of the incidents How did the seats come loose?	1	2	2
They either came out of the tracks used to secure them to the cabin floor  or the tracks themselves came unbolted 	1	1	2
Travel experts said they couldn't remember such a thing happening once  much less three times in rapid succession 	2	1	3
"This should not have happened  says Mark Rosenker  a travel analyst for CBS News  ""These seats are designed to withstand a great deal of force  and they're not supposed to come off their tracks ""What"	3	1	3
went wrong?There are plenty of possibilities: Defective hardware  shoddy maintenance — even tampering can't necessarily be ruled out 	3	1	4
In this case  however  the airline is adamant that the incidents were caused by a maintenance problem  not intentional tampering 	1	1	2
It could be sabotage or it could be just sloppiness  George Hobica of Airfarewatchdog com	3	1	3
Either way  it's a disaster for the airline Is	3	1	3
this really that big of a deal?Travel industry experts say the slightest safety concern could be devastating  especially for a struggling airline 	3	1	3
"If travelers suspect lax maintenance is to blame  says travel analyst Henry Harteveldt  then ""passengers will start booking away from American Airlines in droves "	3	1	2
"This is very serious stuff """	3	1	2
Safety is everything  Hobica says 	3	2	1

Winfrey's network signs deal with Tyler Perry	1	1	1
NEW YORK (AP) — Oprah Winfrey's OWN network is venturing into scripted programming for the first time through a deal with Tyler Perry 	2	1	1
OWN said Monday that Perry will produce  write and direct two series for the cable network to premiere next year 	1	1	1
"Perry is the creative force behind movies like ""Madea's Family Reunion"" and the TBS series ""Tyler Perry's House of Payne """	2	1	1
After its slow start  OWN has been improving its ratings performance recently — in large part through Winfrey's more aggressive booking of interviews for her own show 	2	2	1
Wiresurfer launches online telecom price comparison market	1	1	1
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Inspired by travel sites like Expedia  start-up Wiresurfer com is promising to condense three days work into fifteen minutes for small companies shopping for telecommunications services 	1	3	1
The Coral Springs  Florida based company  is launching its website on Tuesday where small and medium sized businesses can compare prices for telephone and Internet services and see what promotions are on offer in their region 	1	2	1
Businesses can then order their service via Wiresurfer  which has signed up about fifteen telecom partners including AT&T Inc  Comcast  CenturyLink Inc  EarthLink Inc and Windstream Corp 	1	2	1
The idea is that choosing a telecom provider would be made as easy as booking a flight online 	2	2	1
Wiresurfer Chief Executive and co-founder Jeff Kaufman expects big demand for a service that makes procuring telecom services less time consuming 	2	2	1
Small businesses often have to spend up to three days trawling through the websites of multiple phone companies and then calling the companies individually to find the best deals  he said 	2	1	1
"The process of actually shopping for telecommunications services even at the small business level is complex  said Kaufman  ""It's a giant time suck """	3	1	2
The phone companies have agreed to pay Wiresurfer a portion of each customer's phone bill for the duration of their contract with payments ranging from 14 percent to 25 percent of the phone bill  Kaufman said 	1	1	1
With a target market of 50 million U S  small businesses  Kaufman said he hopes to break even about eight months after launch and to have over 16 000 customers within about 30 months 	1	2	1
In the meantime  the company said it has an angel investment of $200 000 from Nantucket based entrepreneur Alan Bankart 	1	2	1
It is also seeking a round of venture capital funding 	1	1	1
If the service takes off then the business telecom services market could potentially become more competitive  according to Gartner analyst Tiffani Bova  who follows technology and telecom sales channels around the world 	2	2	1
If you look at other industries that have had an online marketplace aggregate multiple suppliers they have resulted in creating a much more competitive market  Bova said referring to the travel  hotel and insurance industries 	2	2	1
Even though telecom contracts come up for renewal only once every year or two  Bova argued that even if Wiresurfer gains just a small part of the market it could have a solid business 	2	2	2
There's lots of room here  the analyst said 	3	2	1

Weirdest book-related presidential endorsement ever 	2	2	2
Celebrities have of for presidential candidates  and Samuel L  Jackson is no exception 	2	2	1

Mansbach wrote Jackson's script for this video by the Jewish Council for Education and Research  Wake the F*** Up  which calls on listeners to vote for Barack Obama 	1	2	1

A survey of Indian fiction written in English 	1	1	1
If your knowledge of Indian English literature doesn't extend beyond Salman Rushdie or Jhumpa Lahiri  you've got some catching up to do 	2	1	1

Is Michael Chabon's Oakland accurate?	2	1	1
Two couples lie at the center of Michael Chabon's Telegraph Avenue 	1	1	1
Much has been written about the book's treatment of race 	2	1	2
Slate's Tanner Colby Chabon's decision to create fully realized black characters  but The New Yorker's Matt Feeney finds that his depiction of racial harmony is accurate  if perhaps a bit too optimistic 	2	2	2
"He nails certain aspects of the city  Feeney writes: ""his novel evokes the city’s real racial folkways  the oddly winning blend of prickliness and sociability that I noticed on moving there myself  in August  2004  the month in which the novel is set """	3	2	2
"Reading the novel  he encountered a ""deep friendship between black men and white men  undeformed by neurosis  or suspicion  or cheesy stratagems of pretending to be each other """	2	2	2

Woman sentenced after faking cancer to raise cash	2	2	3
PHOENIX (AP) — A Phoenix woman who pretended to have cancer in order to raise money for breast implants has been sentenced to a year in jail and three years of probation 	2	2	3
She pleaded guilty in August to a theft charge in a plea agreement 	1	2	3
Authorities say Toler helped organize fundraisers and collected more than $8 000 beginning last September 	2	2	1

Woman With Tourette's Says 'Biscuit' 16 000 Times a Day	1	1	1
"She describes her love-hate relationship with the disabling disorder Tourette syndrome in a new diary-style memoir -- ""Welcome to Biscuit Land: A Year in the Life of Touretteshero "" available in October "	2	2	2
"In Britain  ""biscuit"" means ""cookie "" but Thom insists she is never really thinking about eating when she has her involuntary outbursts "	2	1	2
Her brother-in-law recently took note of her verbal tic and counted her saying it 16 times a minute  or about 900 times an hour 	1	1	2
In one day alone  she has hit herself on the forehead with a phone  a carton of apple juice  a set of keys  a toilet roll and a strawberry 	2	1	2
Thom said that for years she viewed Tourette's as a liability  but now she sees it as a strength 	2	2	2
Comparing herself to the film character Bridget Jones  who laughed at her quirks and foibles  Thom recounts hilarious  but also heartbreaking stories of her encounters with a world not used to her social outbursts 	2	3	3
I know I tic all the time and it sort of pisses me off -- biscuit  biscuit  Thom told ABCNews com 	2	2	3
The challenges are dreadful  but it has helped make me a more resilient and empathetic person  she said 	2	2	2
You can overcome most things  and I have become more confident 	2	2	1
The verbal tics can include grunting  throat clearing  shouting and barking 	1	1	1
It was named for a French neuropsychiatrist  Gilles de la Tourette  who assessed the disorder in the late 1800s 	1	1	1
"He did not have the disorder  so it is ""Tourette "" but colloquially  it's called ""Tourette's """	1	1	1
They are frequent  repetitive and rapid 	1	1	1
She is probably not thinking 'biscuit' all the time  said Mink  who does not treat Thom 	2	1	1
"It's kind of an urge of need to do it	2	1	1
648 woman-tourettes-says-biscuit-16-000-times-day-002006414--abc-news-health A lot of people say it's like an itch that needs to be scratched "	2	1	1
He estimates one in 100 children has some degree of Tourette syndrome  a disorder that is little understood and whose cause likely has a genetic link 	2	1	2
Many patients also have symptoms associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder 	1	1	2
The majority of kids  even those bad enough to seek treatment  are likely to have their tics diminish or go away  said Mink 	2	2	2
Habit reversal therapy -- teaching a person with Tourette's to hold their breath  for example  instead of saying the repeated word  can sometimes help 	2	2	1
Antidepressants are used to treat associated anxiety 	1	2	2
I tried instead of banging my chest to try to stretch my arm out  but it didn't work for me  she said 	2	1	2
Thom does take muscle relaxants but other medications have caused undesirable side effects 	1	2	2
"She writes that the physical tics make her feel ""a bit like suddenly being wrenched from the inside or as if someone's put itching powder in my blood """	3	1	2
"Thom lives with a roommate  but she concedes there is still ""quite a lot of risk """	2	1	2
She recently fell in the shower and now uses a wheelchair 	1	1	2
"The intensity of the disorder ""fluctuates and changes "" according to Thom "	1	1	1
She recognizes that uncontrollable swearing can cause problems on her job 	2	1	2
There are people who would argue that exposing children to bad language is not acceptable  she writes 	2	1	2
About two years ago her tic intensified  sometimes she can lose her language altogether 	1	1	2
went smoothly 	1	2	1
"Thoms is eloquent  despite numerous ""biscuits"" and the occasional whooping sound "	1	2	2
The world has not been so empathetic with Thom 	1	1	2
"She writes about asking a staff member for directions at a London subway station: ""He ignored me  so I asked again  but he turned his back on me "	2	1	2
"I explained that I had Tourette's  that if I was swearing or making unusual movements they were not directed at him and that I just needed information  	2	1	2
648 woman-tourettes-says-biscuit-16-000-times-day-002006414--abc-news-health He looked at me and said  'I'm not giving you any f***ing information '"	2	1	2
In the end  he just walked away 	1	1	2
But when her transport pass didn't work  she had to approach him again for help 	1	1	2
Thom burst into tears and with the help of a woman  she was able to leave the station and get a taxi home 	1	2	3
But Thom understands why people are uncomfortable with Tourette syndrome 	2	1	2
There are a lot of myths about it  she said 	2	1	1
"They are frightened by it and the public response is in ignorance or fear	1	1	3 
648 woman-tourettes-says-biscuit-16-000-times-day-002006414--abc-news-health They hear the noises or moving around erratically	1	1	1
648 woman-tourettes-says-biscuit-16-000-times-day-002006414--abc-news-health They laugh at me because they are uncomfortable "	1	1	2
"At the same time  Thom says she has experienced ""incredible kindnesses"" from strangers who took the time to engage with her and listen "	2	3	1
"You've got Tourette's  he told her  ""My best mate of 20 years has Tourette's "	2	1	1
"You're in the right cab """	2	1	1
"A friend  Matthew Pountney  changed her life when the two founded the website Touretteshero and she began to see the ""humor and creativity"" in her condition "	2	2	1
"Pountney described her tics as a ""crazy language generating machine """	2	1	2
"How her brain chooses her tics are a ""complete mystery "" according to Thom "	2	1	1
Sometimes strange ideas come together that would not normally be put together that are visual and interesting 	1	2	1
"Some of her favorites are: ""Capital letters talk to themselves at night """	2	2	1
"Or even ""Hands up  Action Man """	1	1	1
"Her website attracts others with Tourette's and writing for them [and herself] has helped Thom ""reframe"" the negative aspects of her disorder "	1	2	2
Previously  I would get angry or upset  she said 	2	1	2
"I look at a close friend [who has Tourette syndrome] and I can see her tic and recognize that feeling in my body and how it looks from the outside 	2	1	1
648 woman-tourettes-says-biscuit-16-000-times-day-002006414--abc-news-health Never for a moment do I expect her to control that  so I am more patient with myself "	3	2	1
And the writing itself now gives Thom joy 	1	3	1
It's very healing not censoring myself  she said 	2	3	1
One of the things that surprised me about writing was having the chance to articulate my thoughts and share my experiences     I am able to communicate my thoughts without being interrupted 	3	2	1
MEDINAH  Illinois (Reuters) - Tiger Woods may be the greatest golfer of his generation but at the Ryder Cup he has been Joe Average and on Tuesday accepted responsibility for the dismal U S  showing for the past 15 years 	3	3	3
During a period where Woods reigned supreme over the golf world winning 74 PGA Tour titles  including 14 majors  he has been unable to extend his dominance to the biennial competition that pits the U S  best against Europe's best 	2	3	2
A mediocre 13-14-2 mark from six Ryder Cups does not enhance the brilliance resume of Woods  who has been able to celebrate just one team win from six Ryder Cup appearances 	4	3	2
Woods's struggles have coincided with lean times for the U S  with Europe hoisting the Cup in six of the last eight events 	2	1	2
"So I certainly am a part of that and that's part of being a team  I needed to go get my points for my team and I didn't do that	2	1	2

Medinah Country Club  which will serve as the scene for this week's 39th U S -Europe showdown  represents a great chance for Woods to improve his record 	1	3	1
"I've always loved coming here  said Woods  who is also a five-time winner of the PGA Tour event at nearby Cog Hill  ""I enjoy playing in Chicago and for some reason  I've just had a lot of success here "	3	4	1
I don't know what it is but I seem to be very  very comfortable here 	2	2	1
There have been differing theories behind why Woods has not been able to impose his will on the Ryder Cup in the same fashion he has been able to in PGA Tour events 	1	1	2
"Any lesser team that comes to play these guys  they have a tendency to raise their game because it's a huge game for an underdog to play a Tiger Woods  	1	3	1 
649 woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf They get up for it  They are not expected to win """	3	2	2
His singles record of 4-1-1 is impressive  but he does not play well with others as marks of 4-7-1 in foursomes and 5-6-0 in four ball suggest 	2	3	2
In golf's version of speed dating  Woods has been set up with just about everyone but has yet to find someone he truly clicks with 	2	1	2
At Oakland Hills in Michigan in 2004  captain Hal Sutton played the ultimate hunch matching Woods with long-time rival Phil Mickelson in a partnership that failed miserably 	2	1	3
This time it will be up to captain Davis Love III  who has partnered Woods as a player  to find the perfect match for the world number two 	1	3	1
"Steve Stricker has found his way into that pairing because he can handle everything that's going on around Tiger 	2	2	1 
649 woods-accepts-responsibility-u-ryder-cup-woes-220617460--golf It's easier to play with Dustin (Johnson) probably or it's easier to play with Jim Furyk than it is to pair a guy with Tiger because you get the extra attention and the extra pressure """	2	2	2
Workday sets IPO terms valuing company at up to $3 85 billion	1	1	1
(Reuters) - Workday Inc  which provides cloud-based human resource software  said it plans to price its initial public offering of Class A shares at between $21 and $24 each  valuing the Silicon Valley company at up to $3 85 billion 	2	1	1
Workday was co-founded by ex-PeopleSoft executives David Duffield and Aneel Bhusri  who left PeopleSoft following its acquisition by Oracle Corp in 2004 	1	1	1
It confidentially filed for an IPO in July under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act 	1	1	1
The Act allows a company to keep financial details contained in IPO documents private for longer and permits it to keep its registration statement confidential until 21 days prior to the first road show 	1	1	1
The company subsequently filed in August to raise up to $400 million in its IPO 	1	1	1
At the mid-point of Workday's expected range  the offering will raise about $512 million 	1	1	1
Each Class A share is entitled to one vote while each Class B share is entitled to ten votes and is convertible into a Class A share at any time 	1	1	1
Duffield and Bhusri  together with their affiliates  will hold about 67 percent of the voting rights after the offering  the company said in a filing 	1	1	1

The CATCH program targets selected schools in poorer districts without health centers 	1	1	1
If they do not check a box telling the school not to distribute contraceptives to their child  the student may access the drugs without permission 	1	1	1
We wait about a month to give parents a chance to read the letter and opt out  said Caraway 	2	1	1
After that  any student at one of these schools can get emergency contraception or a pregnancy test if they feel they may be pregnant or have had unprotected sex 	2	1	1
Students have long had access to condoms in the city schools 	1	1	1
Last year  Department of Health doctors prescribed Plan B to 567 students 	1	1	1

"She acknowledges that providing contraception does not ""encourage"" more sexual activity and that most parents ""try hard"" to educate their teens about sexual health and values "	2	1	1
But other parents do a poor job talking to their teens 	2	1	2
I do think we need to use caution in providing the Plan B pill to teens who may not fully understand why and how to use it  said Wallace 	3	1	1
"She said schools should have a protocol for how the contraceptive drugs will be distributed and need to provide follow-up to make sure the teen is ""physically OK and to help them make more responsible decision in the future """	2	1	1
There really isn't enough comprehensive sexual health education provided in the schools in general  so it is alarming that they would offer Plan B in the absence of that  said Wallace 	3	1	2

New York judge likely to oversee Facebook lawsuits	2	1	2
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook Inc and most of its adversaries in a raft of lawsuits over its $16 billion initial public offering can agree on at least one thing: that the cases should be heard in a New York court 	2	2	2
At a hearing on Thursday  lawyers for both sides asked a judicial panel to pool together dozens of lawsuits against the social networking company in Manhattan federal court 	1	1	2
In at least 33 lawsuits seeking class-action status  Facebook investors have asked courts to hold the company and its underwriters responsible for causing them losses in the IPO in May 	1	1	2
Investors say they lost money due to technical glitches on the Nasdaq stock market and accuse the company of selectively disclosing unflattering information about its business prospects to Wall Street analysts who then shared it with privileged investors 	1	1	3
Facebook's IPO was one of the most hotly anticipated in recent memory  but the technical malfunctions embarrassed the company and the NASDAQ 	3	3	3
The lawsuits  which seek unspecified damages  could cost Facebook millions of dollars to defend  as it strives to put the IPO problems behind it 	3	1	3
While lawsuits have been also been filed in California  Florida and Washington  D C   most plaintiffs and the defendants say the cases should proceed in New York because witnesses  evidence relating to the IPO  and the underwriter banks are all in that city 	1	1	2
We're glad to be in New York and we'd like to stay here  Andrew Clubok  a lawyer for Facebook  told the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation at the hearing in Manhattan federal court 	2	2	1
"The only lawyer to speak against consolidation of the cases represented plaintiffs in two ""derivative"" lawsuits currently before a federal judge in San Francisco "	1	1	2
Those suits seek to hold Facebook's board and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg responsible for damage they claim was done to the company 	1	1	2
The derivatives plaintiffs say the litigation should take place in California state court  near Facebook's headquarters  for easy access to witnesses and documents 	1	2	1
The 11-judge multidistrict panel  which meets periodically to decide where wide-ranging litigation should be consolidated  is expected to issue a decision within weeks 	1	1	1
Most of the cases are in New York already  and have been added to the docket of Manhattan federal judge Robert Sweet ever since he was randomly assigned the first complaint 	1	1	2
There may be a good chance that Judge Sweet could get this case  panel Judge Paul Barbadoro of New Hampshire said  prompting laughs from the crowded courtroom 	3	2	1
Facebook has said that it did not violate any rules and that Nasdaq was to blame for trading glitches on its first day of trading 	2	2	2
NASDAQ OMX Group Inc is also facing investor lawsuits that claim it was negligent in failing to execute trades in the face of record-breaking volume during the IPO 	1	1	2
William Slaughter  an attorney for NASDAQ  told the judges on Thursday that the exchange agreed those cases should also be before Judge Sweet  but that they should proceed on a separate track from the Facebook lawsuits 	1	1	1

We gave it a listen 	1	1	1
It has a silky feel to it  and it's flexible enough to fit all three models of the iPad  all of which I successfully fit into its flexible slot 	2	3	1
It also works on a MacBook Air  and any other modern laptop with Bluetooth compatibility and a thin screen 	2	2	1
With all the Bluetooth devices with which I tested it  the Zooka paired up easily and sounded a lot better than any onboard speakers 	3	4	1
There's a kickstand that stows away inside  and it's easy to remove it and screw it into the back of the device  turning it into an ideal stand for iPads or other similarly dimensioned tablets  smartphones or music players 	2	2	1
I even tried it with an iPhone 5  which works particularly well in portrait mode because of the little cutout for the iPhone's Home button  and can function in landscape mode if you carefully place it within the silicone slot 	2	3	1
There's even a decent microphone that works well as a speakerphone  and it's great for FaceTime or Skype conversations 	2	4	1
How does it sound?	1	1	1
I tried the Zooka for listening to all types of music  and while its high frequencies and mid-range sound is excellent and surprisingly powerful  the small  side-firing speakers had trouble with bass 	2	4	2
Its sound is nowhere near as good as most of the bulky Bluetooth docks I've tested  but it's certainly a whole lot better than the iPad's and iPhone's internal speakers 	2	3	1
I especially like using the Zooka to watch Netflix video on an iPad 	2	3	1
I noticed the sound was perfectly usable  unless I was watching a movie that had lots of explosions -- making its weak bass response more noticeable 	2	3	2
But there's a trade-off here -- the upside is that it's so portable  you can take it along with you for acceptable sound wherever you go 	3	2	1
Formerly a Kickstarter project  this beautifully designed speaker bar is now available in the Apple Store for $99 95 	1	1	1
