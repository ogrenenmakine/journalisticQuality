Lady Gagas Facebook page has lost the equivalent of three Madison Square Gardens packed full of little monsters this week.[More from Mashable: Instagram Now Has More Daily Active Users on Mobile Than Twitter [REPORT]]Facebook began removing fake likes from brand pages on the social network earlier this week as part of a continued effort to boost the sites integrity. As a result Lady Gagas page lost 65505 fans from Tuesday through mid-Thursday the third-highest drop in likes of any fan page according to data provided to Mashable by FanPageList which tracks numbers for official Facebook fan pages and Twitter accounts.FanPageList analyzed the top 500 pages on Facebook and found that seven of the ten pages that lost the most followers belonged to celebrities including Rihanna Shakira and Justin Bieber. The other three pages were for games: Texas Holdem CityVille and Mafia Wars.[More from Mashable: Kenny Chesney Kicks Off His Shoes With New App]Texas Holdems Facebook page lost nearly 200000 fans in this time period by far the biggest overall decline of any page. CityVilles page lost 72631 fans making it the second biggest decline.Dont feel too bad for these accounts though. When Facebook announced the decision to eliminate likes it said brand pages would lose less than 1% of their total fans on average and sure enough that appears to be the case. All of the brand pages in the top 10 lost fewer than one third of one percent of their total fans. Just a few brand pages in the top 500 lost between 1%-2% of their fans including Breaking News and Air New Zealand.For the most part it appears the worst of Facebooks like purge has passed. FanPageList found that most of these brands lost far fewer fans Thursday than during the previous two days. Some pages like those for Rihanna and Justin Bieber are actually back to adding fans today rather than losing them.Here are the 10 pages that lost the most total fans this week following Facebooks purge:1. Texas Holdem Poker: -198344 fans (-0.30%)2. CityVille: -72631 fans (-0.29%)3. Lady Gaga: -65505 fans (-0.12%)4. Rihanna: -49861 fans (-0.08%)5. Shakira: -48359 fans (-0.09%)6.

WASHINGTON Sept. 19 2012 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- About 2.8 million children or 3.9 percent of all children in U.S. households lived in a household in which at least one member age 12 or older experienced nonfatal violent crime in 2010 according to a report released today by the Justice Departments Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS).About 6 million fewer children in 2010 than in 1993 lived in a household victimized by violence a 68 percent decline over the 18-year period. Over a more recent 10-year period (2001�2010) the number of children living in a household that experienced violence fell about 37 percent.This BJS report estimates the prevalence of violent victimization among U.S. households with children age 17 or younger. The prevalence rate is the percentage of households in which at least one member age 12 or older experienced one or more violent victimizations in a given year. These estimates are an indicator of the extent to which children have direct and indirect exposure to violent victimization.In 2010 violent crime was about twice as prevalent in households with children (3.6 percent) compared to households without children (1.8 percent). More children lived in households where a victimization occurred outside the home (1.7 million or 2.4 percent) compared to inside the home (1.2 million or 1.7 percent).An estimated 1.1 million children lived in a household that experienced a serious violent crime which includes rape sexual assault robbery and aggravated assault. Nearly 1.8 million children lived in a household that experienced a simple assault.Other findings showed�The special report Prevalence of Violent Crime among Households with Children 1993�2010 (NCJ 238799) was written by BJS statisticians Jennifer L. Truman and Erica L. Smith.

With advances in smartphone technology and camera resolution its now easier than ever to capture quality images with the mobile device you carry everywhere. The rise of photo editing apps has added to this movement toward mobile photography which is becoming a burgeoning and reputable art form.[More from Mashable: 4 Tips to Avoid Work-From-Home Email Scams]It may seem like iPhone users or iPhoneographers dominate this art form but theres a sizeable Androidographer community as well especially on platforms like Google+ Instagram and Flickr.We spoke to five photographers who use their Android devices -- exclusively or in addition to other cameras -- to shoot edit and share beautiful photos and they offered some advice for those looking to enter the field.[More from Mashable: 5 Easy Steps To Make Your Job Descriptions Go Viral]Shooting with my Droid is my favorite thing to do with my clothes on Stokes says. She finds her Android device with its camera and sharing capabilities to be a perfect immediate art form. The more pictures I took the more I saw what could be achieved and the more I liked it she says.Stokes enjoys shooting nature -- waterscapes flowers sunrises and sunsets -- as well as anything she sees during the day with an interesting light or unusual aspect. My Android device inspires me with its versatility ... and absolutely beautiful color and results she says.Stokes mentions that mobile photographers should make shooting with their phones a habit or a ritual -- that way it will quickly almost automatically become one of your favorite art forms.I use my Android because it fits in my pocket or purse in a way a DSLR just doesnt she says. Not having a million settings forces me to think about the photo in a different way.Cowden advises mobile photographers to make sure the lens is always clean and to always be on the lookout for natural light. Since the camera phone is not very adjustable I try to start out with good lighting so I can focus on framing and composition she says.For Tidmore the benefit of using an Android device extends past its convenient size -- he likes that everything is maintained on one device. Its being able to do all of my editing and upload [photos] to a social network all on my phone no matter where I am he says. I have a job where Im out and about all day and being able to create on my phone while I should be working is awesome.His main piece of advice for mobile photographers? Experiment with apps. There is no shortage of photography apps in the App Store or Google Play. Spend a lot of time working with different ones until you find your style or something that really clicks with you he advises. Other than that shoot often ... and have fun!Hamelin uses editing apps like UCam Ultra Camera (which allows him to focus easier) and Pixlr-o-matic for filters. The HTC Desire also includes camera software that creates panoramic photos.I always try to have pictures that tell stories or at least that give a feeling Hamelin says. All my pictures taken with my smartphone are made to be seen by my friends that live far away from me [in Belgium] so I try to put what I feel inside.Hamelin suggests that fellow mobile photographers look everywhere shoot move shoot again -- the more you take pictures the more you find what works and what does not.Convenience is the biggest factor Mistry says. I have my phone on me all the time and it has a pretty good camera attached to it. I do usually carry my DSLR around with me too but sometimes its just quicker to get that snapshot with my phone. She explains that being able to share her photos instantly is another reason why her smartphones camera comes in handy.Mistry is an advocate for editing photos but she advises mobile photographers to be smart about it.I know theres a lot of backlash against filters on your photos and I can understand [that] backlash she says. Which is why I say use filters but dont abuse filters. Dont feel the need to add a filter if your photo doesnt need it. Sometimes a photo is perfectly brilliant without a filter over the top of it.This app is a no-brainer. Simple and intuitive Photoshop Express lets you make the necessary adjustments to crop exposure color tint hue saturation contrast and levels with ease. You can create artistic looking shots with the swipe of your finger when you add many of the classic filters from Photoshop including Lens zoom Grain and Glow.While somewhat simple the app works well. Plus it�s free � so if you don�t already have it you should be uploading it now.Price: FREEClick here to view this gallery.Image courtesy of iStockphoto franckreporter.This story originally published on Mashable here.	4	4	4	3	3	3	2	4	3	2	3	2	2	1	4
Staring at cute animals can do wonders for your mental health. But once in awhile Mother Nature reveals her dark side and adorable pets revert to their feral ancestries. A disturbing example: Recently the grisly remains of an Oregon hog farmer were found in a pig pen where the man was last seen attending to his typically non-violent animals. And hes not alone. Here six horrifying instances of pets eating their owners:1. PigsFamily members of 69-year-old Terry Vance Garner were shocked to discover the hog farmers dentures and an undisclosed body part in the familys pig enclosure several hours after Garner went missing. Authorities think Garner either suffered a heart attack or was knocked over by the 700-pound animals before being killed and eaten. His brother describes the self-professed animal lover as a good-hearted guy whose animals were his life.SEE MORE: The flesh-eating seagulls that are attacking whales2. A hippoLast year a 40-year-old former Army major was killed in South Africa after being savagely bitten to death by his pet hippopotamus Humphrey. The man had adopted the 1.2-ton creature when it was just 5 months old after the animal was rescued from a flood. Humphreys like a son to me hes just like a human he said. Theres a relationship between me and Humphrey and thats what some people dont understand. Experts have since noted that hippos are actually the most dangerous animals in Africa killing more people each year than lions elephants leopards buffalo and rhinos combined.3. CatsIn 2010 dozens of cats had to be removed from a northwestern Pennsylvania home where coroners said the animals had started gnawing at the foot of a dead man 74 and his deceased mother 94. The man had apparently been the caretaker for his mother who died of dehydration after her son suffered a heart attack. Left with no other source of food besides their owners corpses the cats survival instincts apparently took over.SEE MORE: Is it wrong to hunt wolves as soon as theyre off the endangered species list?4. PugsIn 2009 a small pair of pugs in Nebraska survived for two weeks on the deceased corpse of their owner after he shot himself. After being found the dogs were subsequently put up for adoption. A Humane Society spokesman said the animals were unlikely to suffer any lasting psychological damage because they dont have memories like people.5. Burmese pythonIn 1996 a 19-year-old Bronx man died after being attacked by his pet Burmese python. Its likely that the 13-foot-long reptile mistook the man for food after it escaped its cage. The man was found by his neighbors in a pool of blood with the snake coiled around his torso in his apartment buildings hallway. According to the mans brother the victim had purchased the snake at a local pet store for $300 a few months earlier.SEE MORE: Are the worlds most endangered species even worth saving?6. Lizards tarantulas spiders and other bugsLoner Voegel 30 lived in 2007 in a small German apartment in the city of Dortmund with a small zoo of more than 200 snakes geckos and insects. Apparently he was killed by a black widow bite and subsequently gorged upon by the other crawly creatures. Neighbors alerted police after the stink emitting from his home became too unbearable. It was like a horror movie says Britains The Sun. They found the mans corpse on the sofa with large chunks of flesh missing. Giant webs draped him spiders were all over him. They were coming out of his nose and mouth said police.Sources: Associated Press (2 3) Guardian New York Times The SunSEE MORE: The futuristic brain implant that makes monkeys smarterView this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	4	4	4	1	4	2	2	4	3	1	3	1	1	3	3
KABUL Afghanistan (AP) � An Afghan soldier turned his gun on American troops at a checkpoint in the countrys east killing two Americans and two fellow members of Afghanistans army in a shooting that marked both the continuance of a disturbing trend of insider attacks and the 2000th US troop death in the long-running war officials said Sunday.The string of insider attacks is one of the greatest threats to NATOs mission in the country endangering a partnership key to training up Afghan security forces and withdrawing international troops.Saturdays shooting took place at an Afghan army checkpoint just outside a joint U.S.-Afghan base in Wardak province said Shahidullah Shahid a provincial government spokesman. At least two Afghan soldiers died he said.Initial reports indicate that a misunderstanding happened between Afghan army soldiers and American soldiers Shahid said. He said investigators had been sent to the site to try to figure out what happened. It was not clear if the assailant was killed.The attack happened about 5 p.m. in Sayd Abad district Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Gen. Zahir Azimi said in an emailed statement. He did not provide further details.NATO forces announced the assault early Sunday morning saying only that it was suspected insider attack and that a NATO service member and civilian contractor were killed.One U.S. official confirmed that the service member killed was American while another confirmed that the civilian was also American. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the nationality of the dead had not yet been formally announced.Afghan soldiers and policemen � or militants in their uniforms � have gunned down more than 50 foreign troops so far this year eroding the trust between coalition forces and their Afghan partners. An equal number of Afghan policemen and soldiers also died in these attacks giving them reason as well to be suspicious of possible infiltrators within their ranks.The attacks are taking a toll on the partnership between international and Afghan forces prompting the U.S. military to restrict operations with small-sized Afghan units earlier this month.The close contact � with coalition forces working side by side with Afghan troops as advisers mentors and trainers � is a key part of the U.S. strategy for preparing the Afghans to take the lead in security operations as the U.S. and other nations prepare to pull out their last combat troops at the end of 2014 just 27 months away.The number of American military dead reflects an Associated Press count of those members of the armed services killed inside Afghanistan since the U.S.-led invasion on Oct. 7 2001.	4	4	4	2	3	2	2	3	3	2	3	1	1	3	3

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook apologized Friday to customers frustrated with glaring errors in its new Maps service and in an unusual move for the consumer giant directed them to rival services such as Google Incs Maps instead.The rare apology follows Apples launch of its own mapping service earlier this month when it began selling the iPhone 5 and rolled out iOS 6 the highly anticipated update to its mobile software platform.Users complained that the new Maps service - based on Dutch navigation equipment and digital map maker TomTom NVs data - contained geographical errors and gaps in information and that it lacked features that made Google Maps so popular from public transit directions to traffic data and street-view pictures.We are extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make Maps better Cook said in a letter to customers released on its website adding that the company fell short of its commitment to deliver the best experience possible to our customers.Unusually he suggested that customers download rival mapping services available in Apples App Store while the company improves the product.While were improving Maps you can try alternatives by downloading map apps from the App Store like Bing MapQuest and Waze or use Google or Nokia maps by going to their websites and creating an icon on your home screen to their web app he said in the letter.Apple is typically loathe to tout rival services and the contrite apology by Cook is an indication of how Apple is changing under the chief executive who took over last year from co-founder Steve Jobs just before his death. It also took the additional step of prominently displaying the rival services on its Apps Store.It is a bit unusual but at the same time Tim is keeping Apples commitment to provide the best user experience for customers Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said. A key reason for Apples success is keeping customers happy so we think this is a good move.People forget that Google Maps started out inferior to Mapquest and Yahoo Maps he added.Apples home-grown Maps feature -- stitched together by acquiring mapping companies and data from many providers including Waze Intermap DigitalGlobe and Urban Mapping -- was introduced with much fanfare in June by software chief Scott Forstall. It was billed as one of the key highlights of the updated iOS6 software.But errors and omissions in the maps service quickly emerged after the software was rolled out ranging from misplaced buildings and mislabelled cities to duplicated geographical features.NEW APPLEThe last time Apple faced such widespread criticism was in 2010 when users complained of signal reception issues on the then-new iPhone 4 model.A defiant Jobs at the time rejected any suggestion the iPhone 4s design was flawed but offered consumers free phone cases at a rare 90-minute press conference called to address those complaints.While Apple fixed the issue Jobs had apologized to users only after he was specifically asked if he was sorry. He also said the issue was shared by all the major manufacturers naming rivals Research in Motion Samsung Electronics and HTC Corp.Cook himself played a key role in convincing Jobs to tackle the negative publicity that arose around that issue something he was initially reluctant to do according to his biographer.Finally Tim Cook was able to shake him out of his lethargy Walter Isaacson said in his biography on the late Silicon Valley icon. He quoted someone as saying that Apple was becoming the new Microsoft complacent and arrogant. The next day Jobs changed his attitude.It remains to be seen how fast Apple can fix the mapping glitches. Jobs had been in a similar position when he allowed email synchronization software MobileMe to launch in 2008 to deadly reviews. The mercurial CEO took the group to task for it and replaced the groups head. The service is now folded into the iCloud product.Mapping is a complex process that takes a lot of resources and years to perfect said Marcus Thielking co-founder of Skobbler maker of the popular GPS Navigation 2 app built using the crowdsourced OpenStreetMap platform.It helps a lot if you have great data to start with he said adding that it appears that different database were thrown together in building Apple Maps. They (Apple) can offer incremental updates and thats what they will do.Cook said that more than 100 million iOS devices are using the new Apple Maps and that the more people use Maps the better it will get. He also offered some hints on why the company decided to remove Google Maps.Apple launched the Google-powered Maps initially with the first version of iOS and created a home-grown version of the service as it wanted to provide more features Cook said.As time progressed we wanted to provide our customers with even better Maps including features such as turn-by-turn directions voice integration Flyover and vector-based maps he said in the letter.Google provides turn-by-turn navigation on Android-based devices but the popular feature was not available for Apple devices. Apple Maps replaced Google Maps in iOS 6 and the Google service is now only available through a browser.Shares of Apple fell 2 percent to close at $667.10 on Nasdaq.(Editing by Edwin Chan and Richard Chang)	4	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	1	2	3

WASHINGTON (AP) � Scientists say the amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean shrank to an all-time low this year smashing old records for the critical climate indicator.The ice cap at the North Pole measured 1.32 million square miles on Sunday. The previous low was 1.61 million square miles in 2007. Records go back to 1979 based on satellite tracking.Ice in the Arctic melts in summer and grows in winter and it started growing again on Monday. National Snow and Ice Data Center scientist Walt Meier (MYur) says man-made global warming has melted more sea ice and made it thinner.Meier says in the 1980s summer ice would cover an area slightly smaller than the Lower 48 states. Now it is about half that size.	2	3	2	2	2	3	2	2	3	2	3	2	1	2	2
BANGKOK (AP) � Asian stock markets rose early Wednesday as investors held onto hopes that the Bank of Japan would conclude a two-day policy meeting by announcing steps to help jumpstart the worlds No. 3 economy.The policy decision could have a significant bearing on how the Nikkei and the rest of the region trades today said Stan Shamu of IG Markets in Melbourne Australia.Investors are also awaiting data on U.S. housing starts and existing home sales to be released later in the day.Japans Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent to 9146.62. Hong Kongs Hang Seng index gained 0.4 percent to 20674.27 and Australias S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 4402.80. Benchmarks in Singapore Taiwan and mainland China also rose. South Koreas Kospi fell 0.5 percent to 1995.09.Wall Street posted mixed results Tuesday after FedEx the worlds second-largest package delivery company cut its outlook for global growth and industrial production while slashing the forecast for company earnings.Also Tuesday the U.S. Commerce Department reported that the current account deficit the broadest measure of American trade dropped 12.1 percent in the second quarter. Thats down from a record high in the January-through-March quarter.The deficit shrank because of an increase in American exports and cheaper oil although economists expect it to grow again because of the global slowdown.Markets had rallied sharply last week after the Federal Reserve announced aggressive measures intended to kick-start the economy and spur job growth.The Fed will purchase an average of $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities until the economy shows significant improvement. The goal is to lower long-term interest rates and encourage more borrowing and spending. The Fed also said it plans to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero until mid-2015.The Dow Jones industrial average rose marginally to close at 13564.64.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Virginia auction house on Thursday cancelled the sale of a Renoir painting bought at a flea market for $7 after signs the work was stolen from the Baltimore Museum of Art decades ago.The painting Paysage Bords de Seine by Pierre-Auguste Renoir was to have gone under the hammer on Saturday but ownership questions halted the sale said Lucie Holland a spokeswoman for Potomack Co the Alexandria Virginia auctioneer.The rest of the auction will go on but the Renoir has been withdrawn she said.A Virginia woman bought the signed French Impressionist painting at a West Virginia flea market a year or two ago hoping the frame would be of some use.She ignored the work until it turned up again while housecleaning and had it appraised by Potomack in July. The auctioneers verified it as a Renoir and estimated its worth at $75000 to $100000.The Baltimore Museum of Art told Potomack on Wednesday that its records indicated Paysage Bords de Seine or Landscape on the Banks of the Seine was stolen while on loan to the museum in 1951 the auction house said.Potomack told the FBI and a federal probe is under way. There is no known police report on the theft.BOUGHT IN PARISThe Renoir came to the Baltimore museum through one of its leading benefactors collector Saidie May. Her family bought the painting from the Bernheim-Jeune gallery in Paris in 1926.The Washington Post found records in the museums library on Tuesday that showed May had lent the paintings and other works to the museum in 1937 Potomack said.After the newspaper told it of the findings the Baltimore museum checked its files and found a loan record showing the Renoir had been stolen on November 17 1951. What happened to it after the theft is unknown.Doreen Bolger the museum director said the museums probe into what happened to the painting was in early stages but was centred on May.She died in May 1951 and the art collection was willed to the museum. As its ownership was going through legal transfer the painting was stolen while still listed as on loan.At this point we just want to make sure that the painting winds up where it belongs and that we provide all the information we can to law enforcement about this issue Bolger said.Potomack said the painting had not turned up when it checked Londons Art Loss Register a database of stolen and lost art. It also consulted the FBIs art theft website to confirm it was not listed as stolen.(Editing by Mohammad Zargham)	4	3	3	4	3	4	4	3	3	2	2	1	1	3	3
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australians are suddenly a whole lot better off after the government statistician found A$325 billion ($338 billion) in share assets previously unrecognized.The Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday released its latest report on household assets which included massive upward revisions to estimates for equity holdings. Total financial assets were now put at A$3.1 trillion at the end of March compared to the originally reported A$2.77 trillion.The revision is worth roughly A$14380 for every one of the countrys 22.6 million people.This issue incorporates new estimates for households holding of unlisted shares and other equity in other private non financial corporations the statistician drily noted.The value of such equity is now put at A$383 billion at the end of March compared to the original A$91 billion.The Bureau of Statistics has effectively found A$325 billion in household wealth said Craig James chief economist at CommSec.Total financial assets also rose further in the second quarter to stand at A$3.11 trillion by the end of June up A$76 billion on the same period last year.No less than A$702 billion of that was held in bank deposits. Australian banks have been competing fiercely for deposits to reduce their dependence on offshore funding while households have been keen to save more in the wake of the global financial crisis.Since the end of 2007 the amount of money stashed in bank deposits has climbed by A$260 billion or almost 60 percent.Australians are continuing their love affair with defensive assets such as cash and bank deposits said James.And its not just Aussie consumers but companies and even superannuation funds he added. Pension or superannuation funds have more than 15 percent of funds in cash and deposits - the highest proportion on record.Non-financial companies held A$395 billion in cash and deposits at the end of June suggesting one reason why lending to businesses has been so sluggish in the last couple of years.The upward revisions to wealth also mean households do not look quite as stretched when compared to their debts.The ABS now estimates the ratio of debt to liquid assets was 129.1 percent in March well down on the original estimate of 170.1 percent.There have been long-standing concerns that the high debt levels of Australian households left them vulnerable to an economic shock such as a sharp rise in the currently low 5.1 percent unemployment rate.(Reporting by Wayne Cole Editing by Kim Coghill)(Wayne.Cole@thomsonreuters.com 612 9373 1813 Reuters Messaging: wayne.cole.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net)	2	3	2	3	4	4	3	2	2	3	2	3	3	2	3

Mike Lake describes his autistic son Jaden as a 3- or 4-year-old trapped in a 16-year-old body a boy unable to speak or comprehend emotions.For Jaden abstract thinking is a challenge and his most direct communication is reaching for his fathers face and crying out bababa when he needs to be understood.But that beautiful simplicity is enough for his dad.I lay down with him on the bed at night and he looks at me in communication mode said Lake 43. Oftentimes I just drift into his language ... He talks along with me at the same time bababa-ing. Its the strangest thing. We are not communicating anything concrete not the world I am living in but for us it is a connection.Since 2006 Lakes world has been Canadas House of Commons where he delves into the complex political issues of the day as a member of Parliament and secretary to the minister of industry.But at home with Jaden he enters a different world where speech doesnt matter as much as unequivocal love.I didnt get elected to Parliament on the autism issue said Lake 42. But as time has gone by its one world. It has allowed me a platform to get out there and raise awareness.I decided early on to include him in every opportunity we could and not to hide the family and to use the opportunities over time to share the story of an amazing kid and what life has been like for us.Lake whose family also includes wife Debbi and 13-year-old Jenay lives in Edmonton Alberta. This week he is in New York City speaking before the fifth annual World Focus on Autism co-hosted by Autism Speaks and Ban Soon-taek wife of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.The world of autism is still a mystery. And while research has advanced particularly in the area of genetics it is still a puzzle to scientists. Some studies show autism strikes as many as 1 in 88 children mostly boys.When something gets in his mind he grabs my face in an escalating bababa until he gets the explanation he needs said Lake. He is obsessed with dogs and will go nose to nose with any dog and he likes baking chocolate chip cookies and bowling Saturday mornings with Dad. But for Jaden who is on the cusp of adulthood the future presents mind-boggling challenges.He has no sense of danger and will cross the street unaware of the traffic. Once on the grounds of the House of Commons he lunged for a German Shepherd security dog grabbing its neck and going mouth-to-mouth with the animal.Though he cannot communicate verbally Jaden is capable of much that might translate into a future vocation: a 130 score in bowling a job cataloging books at the library and making chocolate chip cookies.Here is a kid that when you first see him his skills seem significantly affected then all of a sudden you see him measuring things out and cooking said his father.He is also extraordinarily affectionate not typical in autistic children. In a Canadian television interview with his father ebullient Jaden is a far cry from Dustin Hoffmans character in the film Rain Man a robotic autistic adult.Weve spent a lot of time being in his face and making sure we are physical with him and cuddling him said his father.Each year on April 3 which is World Autism Awareness Day Lake delivers an impassioned speech before the House of Commons -- a very personal one.Mr. Speaker he begins. I never dreamt Id have a son with special needs. But I can honestly say I couldnt be more proud of my boy. He is always quick with a high-five or a kiss is never ever a bully and loves everyone without a hint of judgment. I think we could all use a little more of that.As a politician Lake encourages every family in North America to meet their elected officials and educate them on autism.Bring your loved one with autism I tell people he said. If you cant explain autism because the family member is acting up -- they can explain it better than you ever could.Jaden was diagnosed just before he was 2 but his parents knew there was something wrong before that.He wouldnt respond when calling him and at first we thought he had a hearing problem said Lake. Then we realized when he was two floors away and we turned on [the TV show] Barney he came running down.He was not like a typical kid who once in a while ignores his parents said Lake. He would actually come to get us really as a tool for something he couldnt reach. He would push our arms up to the shelf in the pantry where the treat was he wanted.But Jaden was clever at other things. He could put foam blocks with letters of the alphabet in order without hesitation according to his father.Jadens grandmother was the first to suspect autism when she read a book written by another mother Let Me Hear Your Voice that described Jaden perfectly.All those with autism are different. You have to be an expert at reading your own child said Lake. Jaden is unique -- he wants to talk but he cant. Other kids are completely silent.Jaden gets excited about the film Sound of Music Smarties (Canadian M&Ms) and being told concrete plans about the days schedule. But he cannot articulate his feelings.People with autism have a real hard time even highly functioning people said Lake. And they come across as odd -- and have great difficulty in their social lives.So far in a K to 12 school where Jaden has gone his whole life his classmates have embraced him. He has been involved in musical theater dancing in a production of Oliver and this year learning to play an old man who walks across the stage with a cup.But Jaden is incapable of telling his parents if he has a stomach ache and when his parents ask him he might give a meaningless nod. He wants to make us happy with the answer he gives said Lake. His default answer is yes.They worry about his future when they are not around to love and care for him but hope Jaden can contribute with the skills he does possess.We have chosen to focus on what is in front of us said Lake not ruling out living or vocational opportunities that are good for him.Jaden has had intensive interventions -- about 36 hours a week -- since he was 2. He can use the computer to write down very basic and concrete words but his parents have decided that its more important to interact with him in other ways than to rely on a speech-activated device.Jadens mother cried when he learned to kiss for the first time at age 11.Lake who worked for 11 years for his hometown ice hockey team the Edmonton Oilers said his relationship with Jaden surprises him in some ways.I am a very competitive person so the idea of having a child with special needs would have terrified me he said. I had visions of my son playing in the NHL and graduating with honors. I look back and I cant imagine loving a kid more than I love Jaden. And I look back at every milestone and Im every bit as proud of everything hes done.I always say that if we could snap our fingers and Jaden wouldnt have autism said Lake. Wed miss the Jaden we have now.	2	3	4	3	4	3	2	4	4	2	3	3	3	3	3
LONDON (AP) � The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee was unanimous this month in keeping the interest rates and the economic stimulus program unchanged.Minutes of the MPC meeting released Wednesday show all but one of its nine members are open to another increase in the stimulus program � called quantitative easing � in coming months.Many analysts believe the Bank will increase the stimulus program above the current 375 billion pounds ($610 billion) in November.The minutes showed the committee is waiting to gauge the effectiveness of a new 80 billion pounds Funding for Lending program.The minutes said the success of the program meant to boost credit was difficult to predict because of heightened uncertainty mainly in the eurozone and the reluctance of U.K. households and businesses to spend.	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	4	2	4	2	1	1	1	3
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The surreptitious video recording of a fundraiser held for Republican Mitt Romney in May provided a rare glimpse of how he views supporters of President Barack Obama - as government dependents.It also provided an equally novel sight of a relaxed Romney doing an impression of Henry Kissinger dishing about late-night television talk show host David Letterman and receiving some pointed tips for his presidential campaign.I saw Dr. Kissinger Romney says on the video recounting a meeting in New York with the former U.S. secretary of state. I said to him How are we perceived around the world? And he said one word: Veak!The secretly filmed recording released in its entirety by the liberal Mother Jones magazine on Tuesday opened a window on how Romney acts during the kind of private meeting with donors that is helping to propel the most expensive presidential campaign in U.S. history.In this case the former Massachusetts governor and private equity executive was speaking to donors who paid $50000 each for the privilege of his company at a private dinner at the Boca Raton Florida home of financier Marc Leder.Family and friends often say that Romney who can be awkward while campaigning is at ease and funny when the cameras are off� or believed to be.Youre not eating Romney scolded one attendee during his remarks at the fundraiser.Im mesmerized the donor said.Hes bored to tears Romney said to laughter.At one point Romney decided to give the donor a lesson in eating.You take this your fork and you put it in Romney said.When asked about Democrats criticisms of his tenure as a wealthy executive at Bain Capital Romney pretended to plead poverty.Im poor as a church mouse said Romney who has an estimated fortune of $250 million.NOT UP FOR SLAPSTICKRomney also gossiped about CBS late-night talk show host David Letterman a frequent critic of the Republican. Romney said he preferred Jay Leno host of NBCs The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.Letterman hates me because Ive been on Leno more than him. They are very jealous of each other you know Romney said.By coincidence a few hours after the videos release online Obama arrived in New York City to tape an interview with Letterman.Romney said he turned down an appearance on NBCs Saturday Night Live because visiting the show has the potential of looking slapstick and not presidential.Days before the election in 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin flew to New York to be on the show.ISLAMICS DO NOT WANT TO VOTE FOR YOUAt the Florida fundraiser Romneys comments were captured by a videocamera that had been placed on what appeared to be a marble bar.Waiters wearing white gloves were seen serving the guests red wine from decanters. For most of the video only the backs of donors heads can be seen with Romney in profile.The audio does however pick up donors comments to Romney including some good-natured ribbing about his image on the campaign trail.They say Hes a rich boy one donor affably told Romney during the dinner.The comments reflected donors anxieties about Romneys perceived deficiencies.One donor complained of the difficulties of converting Obama supporters to Romneys side.Right now Im very concerned she said. Women do not want to vote for you. Islamics the majority do not want to vote for you. College students dont.Why dont you stick up for yourself? a male donor asked Romney.You have to show your face more on TV said another.A third donor counselled Romney on the importance of social media.A fourth donor urged Romney to take the gloves off and talk to the people who actually read the paper.When Romney responded to their reservations by telling the guests about the importance of his three debates against Obama in October a donor cut him off.You will do so well the donor said. Your debates are incredible.(Editing by David Lindsey and Prudence Crowther)	3	3	3	3	2	4	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	2	3
LONDON (Reuters) - The British Film Institute (BFI) will invest nearly 500 million pounds ($810 million) over the next five years in a bid to boost the industry and build audiences it announced on Wednesday.Under the title Film Forever: Supporting UK Film 2012-2017 the initiative will involve spending 44.2 million pounds a year on education and audiences 32.3 million annually on film and film making and 9.9 million a year on film heritage.Film Forever is founded on a renewed commitment to the future - the future generation of audiences the future generation of film makers and the opportunities presented by digital technologies said BFI CEO Amanda Nevill.We are investing where we think we can most make a difference she added in a statement.To help build audiences the BFI is concentrating on eight to 10 regional hubs outside London equipping 1000 community venues across Britain and working with Samsung to develop a Smart TV app providing BFI content.Every five to 19-year-old will be offered a film education and the BFI also aims to develop a new youth film Academy with the help of Pinewood Studios and BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts).Direct support for British film will come in the form of more money for production and development rising to 24 million pounds by 2017 from 18 million in 2012 as well as a new talent network and BFI Film Skills Fund.In terms of heritage the BFI wants to digitise 10000 films over the next five years and will hold a public vote to help determine which those films should be.The British film industry contributes 1.6 billion pounds a year to national GDP according to a recent report from Oxford Economics.The same study estimated that including indirect employment tourism trade and merchandise the figure rises to more than 4.6 billion pounds.(Reporting by Mike Collett-White editing by Paul Casciato)	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	1	2	1	1	1	3
LONDON (Reuters) - A Bank of England scheme to give lenders cheap funding will boost credit supply to the recession-hit economy as the majority of Britains big banks have signed up central banker Paul Fisher said on Tuesday.The rate-setter also sounded a note of cautious optimism about the European Central Banks recent steps to calm the euro zone debt crisis though he urged European governments to use the opportunity to find a lasting fix to the crisis which the BoE sees as one of the main drags on the British economy.Britains government and central bank started the new scheme in August hoping to remove one of the obstacles to economic recovery by offering cheap funds to lower banks funding costs.I am confident that the FLS (Funding for Lending Scheme) will help the supply of credit Fisher said in a speech. Before its introduction it was more likely than not that the stock of credit would contract further over the next 18 months.Fisher said that 13 lenders had signed up for the scheme representing 73 percent of the stock of lending to households and companies as of the end of June. A significant number of other institutions were close to signing up too he added.Under the scheme banks and building societies can borrow up to 5 percent of their stock of existing lending from the BoE plus any expansion of its lending during the period between the end of June and the end of 2013.With some 1.2 trillion pounds of lending to firms and households on their books the banks currently participating could tap a total of around 60 billion pounds in cheap funds compared to some 80 billion if all banks took part.It may take banks a while to fully review their lending plans and drawings on the scheme will likely be spread out over the full time frame to the end of 2013 Fisher said. The BoE will provide details about banks use of the scheme on December 3.Fisher said five of Britains six largest banks had signed up for the scheme. HSBC said right at the start it did not want to participate as it preferred to fund lending through customer deposits.CALMER MARKETSA lack of credit is one of the obstacles to recovery for the economy which has been slowly moving out of recession over recent months.Some BoE policymakers have indicated that they believe the funding for lending scheme could be a better way to get a recovery going than further purchases of government bonds with newly created money.Most economists still expect another dose of quantitative easing asset buys once the current 50 billion-pound round is completed in November.Should the FLS succeed in boosting aggregate demand then pressure on the MPC to relax policy will wane Barclays analyst Chris Crowe said in a note.However Crowe was sceptical about the overall impact of the scheme. We do not think that banks will substantially relax lending standards to promote new lending he said.Previous schemes to spur lending since the financial crisis have failed to give a clear boost to the economy. The government has also launched a state-backed business bank to provide more loans to smaller companies.The British Bankers Association (BBA) said that lending to consumers and businesses fell again on the year in August.Over time the Funding for Lending Scheme will improve lending conditions though it is too early to measure any impact yet the BBA said adding that the weakness in the economy may well be the reason why companies were reluctant to borrow.The BoE has said the cost of loans and tighter credit conditions are a major reason for the lack of lending blaming the euro zone debt crisis for a rise in banks funding costs.The ECBs recent decision to buy bonds from countries like Italy and Spain had improved market sentiment Fisher said.I would caution however that we have been here before he said. Along with every other market participant I hope that this time will be different.Politicians now had to use the time provided by the central banks action to take the necessary steps such as improving the competitiveness of southern European countries he said.(Additional reporting by Olesya Dmitracova)	3	4	4	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	3
Aiming to take some of the mystery out of calculating ad spending on Facebook social media marketing firm Syncapse has introduced a free online tool that lets brand managers do the math.The tool which went live Thursday morning takes into account multiple variables that would affect such spending including target market market conditions and interests.[More from Mashable: Facebook Testing Automatic �Photo Syncing� Feature For Android Phones]In a hypothetical example with a very broad target Syncapses calculator recommended that Kraft Foods Oreo brand spend $27.6 million communicating with existing fans next year and $103 million going after friends of fans. Heres how it got to that number:First the calculator asks for the size of your target market. You can also specify interests. Facebook has a database of 8 million or so such interests which can range from celebrities (Martha Stewart) to sports (mountain biking) to TV shows (The Walking Dead.) In this case no interest was specified:[More from Mashable: Arr! The Complete Guide to Celebrating Talk Like a Pirate Day]Scissons acknowledges that the online tool provides a ballpark estimate of spending and that various factors including Facebooks steady stream of new advertising products cant be anticipated. However Scissons says his firm created the tool to illustrate that Facebook is more a platform for CRM than traditional marketing. There are a lot of agencies on the market that are trying to buy cheap fans Scissons says. Were trying to educate the market that they should be thinking of reach and frequency.In the near future Scissons believes marketers will begin to think of frequency as the new advertising and will bank more on exposure via social media than would-be viral campaigns as a driver of purchases. For example a woman who is interested in Coach handbags may be a Facebook fan but she may not be interested in engaging with the brand on Facebook very much. However if shes exposed to the right amount of messaging at the right frequency eventually the brand will reach her when shes in the market for a handbag.If Scissons is right and marketers begin thinking about social media marketing as CRM well see fewer out-of-the-box creative campaigns but marketers may be happier overall with the results.What do you think?

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadas annual inflation rate in August officially slipped to 1.2 percent from 1.3 percent in July but there was in fact little difference between the two months Statistics Canada said on Friday.Statscan analysts said the more precise August figure was 1.24 percent and had been rounded down to 1.2 percent. Julys figure of 1.25 percent had been rounded up to 1.3 percent.Market analysts had expected a 1.3 percent year-on-year increase in August.The steady figure puts little pressure on the Bank of Canada to raise its key interest rate from the current near-record low of 1.0 percent.The central bank which targets a 2 percent inflation rate started signaling in April it might raise rates if the economy continued to grow.The only major component to drop in the 12 months to August was clothing and footwear where prices fell by 1.2 percent on declines in the prices for womens clothing. Energy prices rose 0.8 percent following three consecutive months of year-over-year declines.The Bank of Canadas closely-watched core inflation rate - which strips out the prices of items such as gasoline tobacco and some foodstuffs - dropped to 1.6 percent from 1.7 percent in July. Markets had expected the rate to fall to 1.5 percent.(Reporting by David Ljunggren Editing by Bernadette Baum)	2	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	2	2	2	1	1	1	3

LOS ANGELES (AP) � A chef who boiled his wifes body for four days to hide evidence of her death was convicted of second-degree murder Thursday.In a recorded interrogation presented by prosecutors during the trial David Viens 49 can be heard saying he cooked the body of his 39-year-old wife Dawn in late 2009 until little was left but her skull.The chef spoke to authorities from a hospital bed in March 2011 after leaping off an 80-foot cliff in Rancho Palos Verdes. Authorities say he jumped after learning he was a suspect in her disappearanceThe trial relied heavily on recorded interviews with authorities in which the chef acknowledged the crime in detail.I just slowly cooked it and I ended up cooking her for four days Viens could be heard saying on the recording.Viens who attended his trial in a wheelchair said in the interview that he stuffed his wifes body in a 55-gallon drum of boiling water and kept it submerged with weights.He said he mixed what remained after four days with other waste dumping some of it in a grease pit at his restaurant in Lomita and putting the rest in the trash.He said he stashed his wifes skull in his mothers attic in Torrance. But a search of the house turned up nothing nor did an excavation of the restaurant.On the recording played in court Viens was asked what happened on Oct. 18 2009 the night his wife disappeared.He said he had noticed money missing from his restaurant and suspected his wife. They got into an argument he said and he forced her onto the floor where he wrapped her up and put a piece of duct tape over her mouth before going to bed.He awoke to find her dead and panicked he said.Viens had pleaded not guilty.	3	4	3	4	3	2	3	3	4	2	3	2	1	5	3
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming will visit Canada next week as Ottawa deliberates whether to approve a landmark $15.1 billion takeover of oil producer Nexen Inc by state-owned Chinese oil company CNOOC Ltd.CNOOC said it did not expect Chen to raise the sensitive takeover bid during talks with the Canadian government. Canada China Business Council president Peter Harder however said he would not be surprised if Chen mentioned it in a speech to his group next Tuesday.Although Canada is seeking substantial foreign investment in its oil and gas industry the CNOOC move is raising concern inside cabinet where some members are wary of letting a Chinese state-owned enterprise buy up domestic assets.Industry ministry officials are looking closely at the bid to determine whether it is of net benefit to Canada.Separately Canadas spy service said some foreign state-owned enterprises could pose a threat to national security. It did not mention China by name.Canadian Trade Minister Ed Fast gave little away when asked about a planned meeting with Chen in the next few days.I do expect it will be a productive meeting as we move the Canada-China relationship forward he told reporters on Friday.Nexen - whose shareholders voted to accept the CNOOC deal on Thursday - said it was unaware of Chens visit.A spokesman for CNOOC said it did not expect Chen and Fast to discuss the bid because this is transaction between two commercial companies not a government to government affair. The Chinese embassy was not immediately available for comment.Chinas Ministry of Commerce is responsible for authorizing investments of more than $100 million by state-owned enterprises.When Chen addresses a lunch arranged by the Canada China Business Council next week in Toronto he could well talk about the CNOOC bid council president Harder said noting the minister had done so in a speech in Beijing last week.I think he would express the view that the transaction should be looked at as a business transaction and be seen on its merits and that China would hope that that would be the case he told Reuters in a phone interview.Harder said that in Chens Beijing speech last week he had mentioned a foreign investment promotion and protection agreement signed by Canada and China this month as well as Chinas willingness to broaden economic relations between the two countries.Canada says it needs C$630 billion ($643 billion) in investment in its energy sector over the next decade. It is also promoting the idea of oil sales to China.Critics of the CNOOC deal point out that China is running a large trade surplus with Canada. They also complain Canadian natural resources companies find it hard to operate in China.Canadas spy service in a report issued on Thursday said some bids by state-owned enterprises to gain control over strategic sectors of the Canadian economy could threaten national security interests.The foreign entities might well exploit that control in an effort to facilitate illegal transfers of technology or to engage in other espionage and other foreign interference activities the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) said.CSIS expects that national security concerns related to foreign investment in Canada will continue to materialize.Pressed about the report Fast said Canada always took security into account when negotiating economic deals.

DENVER (Reuters) - The frozen corpse that has inspired a Colorado towns whimsical Frozen Dead Guy Days celebration may soon be put on ice somewhere else but festival organizers said the bodys removal will not have a chilling effect on the annual event.We will continue on whether or not Bredo Morstoel is here festival owner Amanda MacDonald said Wednesday of the man whose body has been packed in dry ice outside Nederland Colorado since 1993.A financial dispute between Morstoels grandson Tryve Bauge and the man hired to replenish the dry ice on a monthly basis Bo Shaffer has led to Bauge threatening to move his grandfathers body out of Colorado.Each month for 18 years Shaffer has hauled 1700 pounds (770 kg) of dry ice - carbon dioxide in solid form - to a remote shed above Nederland to keep the corpse of Morstoel at minus-24 degrees Fahrenheit (minus-31 degrees Celsius) and in a state of cryonic suspension.But Shaffer said he quit after Bauge refused to pay for the rising costs of fuel and ice which has made the endeavour unprofitable.It takes two of us to make the four-hour roundtrip Shaffer told Reuters. My quitting is the only way to get his (Bauges) attention.Bauge who lives in Norway did not immediately return an email message seeking comment about the dispute. But he told the Boulder Daily Camera newspaper that he is exploring the possibility of moving his grandfather to the Cryonics Institute in Michigan.Cryonics is the process of freezing and storing a corpse to prevent decomposition in anticipation of medical technology that could bring the dead back to life. Liquid nitrogen which is far colder than dry ice is typically used for cryonic preservation.Morstoel died of heart failure in his native Norway in 1989 and Bauge had his grandfathers body frozen and transported to a cryonics facility in California. Ultimately he had the corpse moved to Nederland where Bauge lived at the time.When Bauge was deported because of an expired visa he hired Shaffer to act as an unofficial caretaker.COFFIN RACES HEARSE PARADEAt first townspeople in the mountain village 17 miles (27 km) southwest of Boulder Colorado were aghast at the thought of a frozen body being stored in their midst.But they ultimately embraced the idea of an annual festival surrounding its most famous albeit deceased resident.The late-winter celebration features activities such as coffin races a hearse parade a frozen salmon toss and snow beach volleyball. There are even tours to the site of Morstoels sarcophagus although his remains are not open for viewing.MacDonald said the festival attracts about 10000 people over its three-day run which is held in early March and has taken on a life of its own with or without its namesake dead guy.The nonprofit Cryonics Institute in Clinton Township Michigan was founded by the late physicist Robert Ettinger who was known as a pioneer in cryonics.His son David Ettinger said by telephone that privacy concerns prevent him from discussing any potential patients. However he did say ideal candidates for suspension are people who have recently died.Such was the case with his father he said who was prepared for the procedure in the days before his death in 2011 at the age of 92.Weve never had a patient presented to us under those circumstances he said of a corpse that has been packed in dry ice for nearly two decades.The institute has about 100 suspended corpses and charges a one-time $35000 fee and $120 annually for human cryopreservation.(Editing by Steve Gorman and Xavier Briand)	4	3	2	4	3	3	3	4	4	2	3	2	2	2	3
KINSHASA (Reuters) - Any Tintin fan would feel at home in the small wooden shed in a back street of Democratic Republic of Congos capital Kinshasa where the shelves are crammed with brightly painted statues from the famous Belgian cartoon characters adventures.Friendly faces are everywhere - the tufted-haired Tintin the bearded Captain Haddock and the bumbling policemen Thomson & Thompson - lovingly carved from wood and carefully painted in bold colours.But with Kinshasa preparing to receive a flood of visitors for an international summit of French-speaking countries next month some are questioning whether Congo should turn its back on the boy journalist whose fictional adventures in the then-Belgian colony depicts Africans as dull-witted and childish.Tintins relationship with Congo dates back to 1930 when his creator Georges Remi - better-known by his pen name Herge - first wrote Tintin in the Congo in which the intrepid reporter and his little white dog Snowy tackle wild animals hunters diamond smugglers and warlike local chieftains.Tintin statues - which can sell for anything from $15 to $1500 - are part of Congos roaring trade in the comics memorabilia business that could receive a boost next month as delegates from 56 countries across the French-speaking world gather in Kinshasa for the Francophonie summit.Tourists can find stalls and street vendors across the riverside capital selling the figures and can even buy personalised paintings of the books front cover with their names expertly added by the artist.But it is Herges heavily stereotyped depiction of Africans as fat-lipped childlike savages that makes Tintin a controversial cultural figure for a country trying to turn its back on a brutal colonial past followed by decades of dictatorship and conflict according to professor Joseph Ibongo Gilungule the director of Congos national museum.Tintin is an image created by westerners and it proves the ignorance of these people a lack of understanding for our values Ibongo told Reuters.Ibongo wants more people to celebrate the rich cultures of the countrys estimated 250 ethnic groups.His museum is a celebration of the masks headdresses and clothing that have played an integral part in Congos traditional values but few of the countrys 70 million inhabitants come to visit the museum.BANISHED TO THE TOP SHELVESIbongo is not against preserving relics of Congos colonial past - he is trying to find money to rehabilitate the statue of controversial British colonial explorer Henry Morton Stanley which lies forlornly toppled behind a shed at the museum.Nonetheless with so many people due to visit the country for the Francophonie summit in October he believes Congo should find a better poster boy than Tintin.There are other strong images which speak positively of this country its peoples... It would be more respectful to Congo and the whole of Africa if we spoke of images that value the Congo and not Tintin Ibongo added.Earlier this year a Congolese man studying in Belgium tried and failed to have the book banned on the grounds of racism. Some stores in Britain have banished it to the top shelves where only adults can see it.Even Tintins creator Herge later re-wrote parts of the story toning down the more extreme stereotypes which sprang from Belgiums colonisation of Congo which was brutal even by the standards of the day.Auguy Kakese an artisan who specialises in Tintin statuettes acknowledges that it was Europeans who first suggested he carve the figures and most of his clients remain westerners. But he sees no harm in it.Its humour its not racist... for those who say its racist I say that in the comic strip you never see images which show him trying to kill the Congolese Kakese said in his workshop which employs 10 people and produces thousands of Tintin statues.Although most of the statues Kakese sells are of the comics European characters he does not shy away from depicting the Africans as well despite them seeming uncomfortably stereotyped for modern tastes.We were a Belgian colony if we work with Tintin now its to say that the Belgians are still our brothers he added.A recent showing in Kinshasa of the Steven Spielberg-directed Tintin movie attracted a small but varied audience everyone from Congolese to Koreans.Although the audience were aware of the cartoons sometimes complex relations with Congo none saw it as a huge problem.I really dont think it is racist it was just the whites wanting to interpret what they saw in Congo at the time Congolese Tito Biteketa said.Christiana Finotti an Italian expatriate said she had bought a Tintin picture for her friend but acknowledged that not all her Congolese colleagues were comfortable with the association.Tintin in the Congo is still a little difficult due to the style of Belgian colonialism and due to the history... I think theres been a reconciliation but the reconciliation hasnt been easy she said.(Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Paul Casciato)	4	4	3	2	4	3	2	4	3	2	3	2	1	1	4
MEDINAH Illinois (Reuters) - Fans can expect a high-octane contest between two star-studded teams in this weeks Ryder Cup at Medinah where the United States host holders Europe for the 39th edition of the biennial competition.Never before has the trans-Atlantic showdown featured two line-ups bristling with so much firepower and strength in depth with big-hitting world number 35 Nicolas Colsaerts of Belgium the lowest-ranked of the 24 golfers in action.For the first time in two decades a European team can boast the games leading player and in Rory McIlroy they possess a man who has already been targeted by the United States.Obviously hes a marked man U.S. Ryder Cup veteran Jim Furyk said at last weeks Tour Championship in Atlanta. Hes the number one player in the world. Hes going to garner all the attention as well he should. Hes played phenomenal this year.(He) won the PGA (Championship) by a ton of shots ... hes right now the present-day Tiger Woods where everyones eyes are on him.While double major winner McIlroy heads the world rankings Europe also have third-ranked Luke Donald Lee Westwood (four) Justin Rose (five) Graeme McDowell (18) and Sergio Garcia (19) among a total of nine players in the top 30.The U.S. counter with 11 in the top 20 - Woods (two) Bubba Watson (seven) Webb Simpson (eight) Jason Dufner (nine) Steve Stricker (12) Dustin Johnson (13) Keegan Bradley (14) Matt Kuchar (15) Phil Mickelson (16) and Zach Johnson (17).Its pretty phenomenal really said Furyk who this week will be playing on his eighth U.S. Ryder Cup team. To have 24 players of the top 35 is mind-boggling.We are really happy with our team its really strong but we have our hands full. Theres a strong team on the other side and well have to play them real tough.Europe have triumphed eight times in the last 13 Ryder Cups but they face a challenging task on American soil where the U.S. have lost only three times since the matches began in 1927.We are playing away and they are going to have the crowd advantage said European captain Jose Maria Olazabal. They are going to set up the course to their liking.At the end of the day we are going to have to play really very very well and hard if we want to have a chance to win.CLOSELY MATCHEDHowever Spaniard Olazabal also felt the two teams would be very closely matched.Ive always said that I dont see any favourites in this Ryder Cup he said. Both teams are playing very strong. The U.S. team is always strong. They have played great.They won the Masters (through Watson) this year. They won the U.S. Open (Simpson). They won a bunch of tournaments. I dont see any favourites at all.Since 1981 there has been very little to choose between the two teams in terms of matchplay grit and ability. The knack of holing putts at the right time under intense pressure has been the decisive factor.The Americans last won the Ryder Cup at Valhalla in 2008 when their captain Paul Azinger shrewdly inspired team cohesion with a four-man pod system and prepared the venue with very little rough and fast greens to suit his power hitters.This week U.S. captain Davis Love III has set up Medinah Country Clubs No. 3 Course in similar fashion.You dont want to see players chipping out (from rough) and putting for par at the Ryder Cup said Love who competed in six Ryder Cups. You want to see birdies. You want to see excitement.Weve set it up the way we think fans will like it. Were a long-hitting free-wheeling fun-to-watch team. And I think its going to be fun to watch.Woods the greatest player of his generation and arguably of all time missed out on the U.S. Ryder Cup victory in 2008 while recovering from knee surgery. No surprise then that he is eager to taste team success this week at Medinah.Ive only been part of one winning Ryder Cup team since my (debut) time in 97 he said. We didnt play well at the right time and thats just the way it goes. Hopefully this year well play well at the right time.The 39th Ryder Cup starts on Friday morning with the opening foursomes matches.(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes Editing by Frank Pingue)	4	4	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	2	4	2	2	1	4
DENVER (AP) � An argument over whether wolves should be returned to Rocky Mountain National Park to reduce an overabundance of elk is moving to a federal appeals court.The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Colorado will hear the case Thursday.The park often has so many elk that they overgraze on trees shrubs and grass leaving other animals without enough food and habitat. Few natural predators are left there and hunting is prohibited in all national parks so little remains to keep the elk population in check.The park uses National Park Service personnel and trained volunteers to periodically shoot and kill a specified number of elk. Officials rejected the idea of reintroducing wolves to prey on the elk and control their numbers saying it was infeasible.They cited a lack of support from other agencies safety concerns of people who live nearby expected conflicts between wolves and humans and the amount of attention that a wolf population would require of park officials.The wildlife advocacy group WildEarth Guardians sued the Park Service in 2008 asking a Denver federal court judge to overturn the policy. The group said the Park Service didnt fully consider reintroducing wolves and that using volunteers to kill elk amounts to hunting in the park which would violate federal law.The judge disagreed upholding the policy in 2011 and WildEarth Guardians appealed to the 10th Circuit.Rocky Mountain National Park launched a 20-year program in 2008 to thin the elk herd by shooting a number that varies from year to year depending on the size of the parks overall herd. The program also includes fencing elk out of some areas to protect vegetation and redistributing some of the animals.Park spokeswoman Kyle Patterson said 131 elk have been killed in the culling program during the winters starting in 2008 2009 and 2010.The current size of the elk herd in the parks lower elevations is 600 to 800 which is within the target range set by the program so no elk were killed last year. The park website says weather hunting outside the park and changes in elk movement patterns have helped keep the numbers low.No decision has been made on whether or how many elk will be killed in the upcoming winter.Wolves disappeared from many parts of the West after decades of hunting and government-backed extermination. They were re-introduced in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming in 1995 and some advocates have argued for bringing them back elsewhere.Wolves ignite heated and emotional debates in the West with some people saying the predators are a threat to human safety and ranchers livelihoods and others arguing they are a vital part of natural ecosystems and inspiring to see in the wild.By contrast the arguments in the lawsuit before the 10th Circuit are largely about dry-sounding procedural questions chiefly whether the Park Service followed the letter of the law in rejecting wolf reintroduction and whether using trained volunteers to shoot excess elk is culling or hunting.The 10th Circuit normally meets in Denver but will hear oral arguments in this case at the University of Colorado Law School in Boulder as part of an outreach program.___On the Web:Rocky Mountain National Park Elk and Vegetation Management Fact Sheet: http://www.nps.gov/romo/parkmgmt/elkveg_fact_sheet.htmWildEarth Guardians Wolf Den: http://www.wildearthguardians.org/site/PageServer?pagename=priorities_wildlife_wolves&AddInterest=1228___Follow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	2	3	3	1	1	2	4
Cavities can be excruciating and new evidence suggests prehistoric man used a surprisingly sophisticated technique to deal with the pain: Dental fillings. A team of scientists in Italy have identified a 6500-year-old cracked tooth repaired with beeswax suggesting our early ancestors knew a thing or two about dental work. A closer look at the findings:What did researchers find?The study outlined in the journal PLoS One takes a look at a fossilized jaw bone discovered in Slovenia near Trieste. Of special interest was the left canine which sported a large crack that exposed some of the inner enamel and tissues within the tooth called dentin says Brian Fung at The Atlantic. In other words: It probably caused a lot of pain.SEE ALSO: Proof that Star Treks warp drive might actually work?And it was repaired with beeswax?Yes. Infrared spectroscopy confirmed the ancient filling to be beeswax while radiocarbon dating found that it was about 6500 years old. In all likelihood the procedure was done either shortly before or after the 24- to 30-year-old individuals death. The team could not rule out the possibility that the wax was added during a funerary ritual says Rossella Lorenzi at Discovery News although evidence suggests it was added while the young man was still alive.Why do they think that?The severity of the crack has researchers believing the tooth was incredibly sensitive and probably caused him a lot of discomfort. For example other teeth had exposed dentin yet no beeswax was applied. That means if the dental work was done when he was still alive they write the intervention was likely aimed to relieve tooth sensitivity derived from either exposed dentin... or the pain resulting from chewing on a cracked tooth. Essentially its the oldest therapeutic-palliative dental filling found to date.SEE ALSO: The 8-year-old who discovered a $65000 piece of whale poopWas the cavity caused by eating bad food?Probably not. The severe wear and tear on the tooth was probably due to other activities says Charles Choi at LiveScience. Men for instance regularly used their teeth to soften leather or help make tools. At the moment we do not have any idea if this is an isolated case or if similar interventions were quite spread in Neolithic Europe researcher Frederico Bernardini tells LiveScience. The next project for the team will be to figure out how widespread these types of dental practices really were.Sources: The Atlantic Discovery News LiveScience Medical News TodayView this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this section:	3	3	4	3	2	2	2	3	2	2	2	3	2	2	3
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The tale of how the worlds most beloved nanny Mary Poppins flew from the pages of a popular book onto the big screen is the subject of a new film starring Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson Disney said on Wednesday.The film called Saving Mr. Banks began production on Wednesday. It tells of Walt Disneys 20-year pursuit of the film rights to author P.L. Travers novel Mary Poppins Walt Disney Cos movie studio said in a statement.Hanks will play Walt Disney marking the first time the legendary animator and film producer has ever been depicted in a dramatic film. Thompson will play Travers who reluctantly granted Disney the film rights while demanding script and character control that clashed with Disneys vision for the movie musical.Mary Poppins was released in 1964 and won five Oscars including a best actress award for Julie Andrews in the title role best original score and best song for Chim Chim Cher-ee.The story of the magical English nanny who flies with her umbrella has also been made into a hit stage musical playing on Broadway. The Cameron Mackintosh production was also a hit in Londons West End.John Lee Hancock whose best-known films include The Rookie and The Blind Side will direct Saving Mr. Banks. The film also stars Colin Farrell as Travers father and Rachel Griffiths as her aunt.Saving Mr. Banks will be released sometime in 2013 Disney said.(Reporting by Nichola Groom Editing by Jan Paschal)	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	4	3	2	3	2	3	1	3
We wont find out who won the presidential race until Nov. 6 (or later) but the election has actually already started. As of last weekend people in 25 states can already vote through excuse-free absentee ballots or early in-person voting. That means six weeks before Election Day half the country can cast ballots � and skip the presidential debates ignore unpredictable world events and hidden videos and TiVO away the political ads. And a record 35 percent of voters probably will cast their ballots early according to George Mason Universitys Michael McDonald. This is a problem for many reasons says Matt Lewis at The Daily Caller. Among them: Early voting is expensive for states and campaigns sends voters to the polls prematurely and most importantly doesnt work. In fact researchers at the University of Wisconsin demonstrated that early voting can actually depress turnout � largely by mitigating get-out-the-vote efforts and diminishing the civic engagement attraction of Election Day. Could the effort to expand voting opportunities actually be bad for democracy?Yes. Early voting is a travesty: The first problem with early voting is that it isnt fair says Ed Lasky at American Thinker. Letting people lock in their votes before the debates can enlighten voters ads can educate them and bad jobs numbers can reflect poorly on the incumbent is a travesty. Then theres the issue of fraud with absentee ballots. Yet sadly few critics have pointed out how damaging early voting can be to our democracy.The early voting travestySEE MORE: The battle over voter ID lawsHuh? Early voting is good for democracy: Most of the oppositions reasons are nonsense says Jazz Shaw at Hot Air. Absentee-ballot fraud is a myth the cost issue is either the campaigns problem or up to the voters of each state and the study about early voting depressing turnout relies on torturing the data with so many vague and glossy variables... that it becomes a very murky soup. Besides as a general rule opposing extended voting opportunities is an idea which immediately sets off alarms for me as it should for anyone who values participatory democracy.Should there be early voting?Like it or not early voting may kill Election Day: Early voting is gaining ground � and thats kind of sad for civic engagement University of Wisconsin political scientist Barry Burden tells the AP. Before early voting took off you could go into your workplace and see co-workers with I voted stickers on their lapels and your childrens school might be a polling place. Election Day was a community and media event and it was hard to miss. If early voting eventually relegates the first Tuesday in November to the nostalgia bin many people who are on the edge of voting probably wont cross the finish line.Vote early: Skip the lines maybe the debates tooSEE MORE: Are Republicans in danger of losing the House?Read more political coverage at The Weeks 2012 Election Center.View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	3	3	4	4	3	4	2	2	3	1	3	3	2	3	4
Most parents are anxious to steer their kids away from drug and alcohol abuse. But whats the best way to do it? A new study by public health analyst Christine Jackson of the research institute RTI International along with colleagues at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that an unexpectedly high number of mom and dads think they can avoid raising kids who become irresponsible drinkers by exposing them to small amounts of alcohol � a sip of beer a little wine � at a young age. Is that really a good idea? Here a brief guide:How many parents believe in introducing their kids to booze in tiny increments?Jackson and her fellow researchers surveyed 1000 mothers and their third-grade children in North Carolina South Carolina and Tennessee and found that 40 percent of moms believed that forbidding alcohol would only make their kids more rebellious. One-fifth of the moms believed the occasional sip of wine or beer at dinner would help inoculate young kids against the lurking dangers of peer pressure says Doug Barry at Jezebel making them less drawn to experimenting with risky heavy drinking in their teen years.SEE MORE: The increasing prevalence of new moms sharing breast milk: A guideAre these parents actually giving their young kids booze?Many are according to Jackson. One-third of the third graders the study examined had already tried beer wine or in some cases even hard liquor. The study suggests that their parents � at least those who know about the drinking � think the kids will take the responsible drinking habits they learn at home under mom and dads watchful eyes out into the world. Not so fast health experts warn.What does early drinking really do to kids?Numerous studies over the last several years have found that early-onset drinking is a known primary risk factor for problem drinking during adolescence the researchers write. And remember teenage brains have underdeveloped brakes making teens more likely to mimic their peers dangerous behavior when partying rather than the moderate drinking styles of parents at the dinner table.SEE MORE: The professor who breast-fed while teaching: Inappropriate?So whats a mom or dad to do?Try and delay exposure to alcohol for as long as possible says Ralph Hingson director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholisms Division of Epidemiology and Prevention Research. Jackson says even a few sips could be enough to put a kid at risk although some health experts arent so sure. The most important factor is the age at which kids first get drunk says Tim Stockwell director of Canadas Center for Addictions Research of British Columbia. That predicted far more than the age at which they first had a drink and Im thinking that would apply to a sip.

One of the stalwart units of astronomy just got a makeover. The International Astronomical Union the authority on astronomical constants has voted unanimously to redefine the astronomical unit the conventional unit of length based on the distance between the Earth and the sun.The new definition is much simpler than the old one says Sergei Klioner of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany one of a group of scientists who worked decades toward the change which took effect last month during an IAU meetingUnder the new definition the astronomical unit (or AU) � the measurement used for the Earth-sun distance � is no longer always in flux depending on the length of a day and other changing factors. It is now a fixed number: 149597870700 meters which is the equivalent of almost 92.956 million miles.Klioner explained the simpler definition is helpful for instance for scientists who formulate ephemerides � tables that give the precise position of astronomical objects in the sky. They utilize the astronomical unit to calculate the motion of bodies in the solar system. [Solar System Explained From the Inside Out (Infographic)]The broader community of astronomers are able now to better with less efforts understand what their colleagues � astronomers who are experts in planetary ephemerides � do and how they produce the high-accuracy theories of motion in the solar system he told SPACE.com by email.The revision also makes the unit easier for engineers software designers and students to understand Klioner and his colleague Nicole Capitaine of Paris Observatory noted.At the same time the redefinition can serves an epitaph to the bygone era when Earth-bound scientists depended on viewing angles to calculate celestial distances.An established unitLacking precise instrumentation early astronomers relied heavily on angles to calculate the size of the universe. By studying Mars from two separate points on Earth 17th-century Italian astronomer Giovanni Cassini was able to use trigonometry to calculate the distance from Earth to the sun with only about a 6 percent error.Expressing distances in the astronomical unit allowed astronomers to overcome the difficulty of measuring distances in some physical unit Capitaine told SPACE.com by email. Such a practice was useful for many years because astronomers were not able to make distance measurements in the solar system as precisely as they could measure angles.Modern instruments can come within a few meters of exactly determining distances of over 150 million meters or some 93000 miles.The astronomical unit eventually came to be defined by a mathematical expression that involved the mass of the sun the length of a day and a fixed number known as the Gaussian gravitational constant. Because the Earth orbits its star in an ellipse rather than a circle the length of a day shifts over the course of a year. At the same time the sun is constantly transforming mass into energy.In the 20th century famed scientist Albert Einstein added general relativity to the mix. According to the famous theory space-time is relative depending on ones frame of reference.The new fixed number is the best estimate of the original expression Klioner said.If we would decide to continue with the old definition we would have to add several additional conventions to make the latter meaningful in the framework of general relativity he explained. A better way was to change the definition completely � and this is what we succeeded in doing.Capitaine said The change of definition of the astronomical unit mainly concerns those in the field of high-accuracy solar system dynamics.Satellites and other crafts traveling in space are not affected because they rely on set distances.The distance between the Earth and the sun as any physical distance should be measured and cannot be fixed by any sort of resolution Klioner said.The times they are a-changingCapitaine and Klioner are among several scientists who worked over the last two decades on a revision of the astronomical unit. Capitaine said she first got involved when she gave a presentation in 1994 with Bernard Guinot also of Paris Observatory. Over the course of 10 years several published papers by various scientists discussed the ramifications of changing the stalwart unit. The three scientists presented the issue to the astronomical community on a number of different occasions.Other astronomers helped to demonstrate the feasibility of the change before it landed on the table of one of the working groups for the International Astronomical Union. The resolution was reworked several times before it won unanimous passage.The change as we have it now is really a product of collective work Klioner said.He went on to add I think that the energy commitment and the worldwide scientific reputation of Nicole Capitaine were crucial for getting this change through.Shifting from a constantly changing value to a fixed number may seem like an easy choice but the group faced some resistance. Some believed that the overhaul would be too difficult to implement with crucial software while others were concerned that discrepancies might be introduced into past work. Still others were uncomfortable changing such a historic definition. Eventually all concerns were apparently met. Within the last two years I have not heard a single objection for the change itself Klioner said.Follow SPACE.com on Twitter @Spacedotcom.

Only our totally unbiased watchdog media could turn the burning of U.S. embassies in countries where Barack Obama had recently supported mob revolts into Mitt Romneys blunder. Journalists couldnt risk having Obamas campaign slogan Osama is dead being amended with and so is our ambassador.After our ambassador to Libya was murdered in a preplanned coordinated attack on our embassy last week preceded by an attack on our embassy in Egypt (and followed by attacks on our embassies in Yemen Indonesia Tunisia and Lebanon) Romney criticized the Obama administration for sympathizing with those who had breached our embassy in Egypt.He was referring to a statement put out by our Cairo embassy before the ambassadors murder criticizing an American filmmaker whose YouTube trailer was the alleged provocation for the attacks. Attacks that happened to occur on the anniversary of 9/11.The NFM (Non-Fox Media) uniformly denounced Romneys criticism and pronounced his campaign finished.The Obama administration insisted that Romney had his facts wrong: Obama had absolutely nothing to do with the statement -- the embassy staff was freelancing -- and even if the White House had approved it it was a good statement because the riots were caused by the movie trailer and furthermore the embassy statement was issued before the riots even began.This is known as an argument in the alternative: I didnt break into that house and if I did I didnt steal the silver and if I did I only got twenty bucks for it.If the statement were issued before our embassy in Cairo was attacked then what was the administration responding to? Does the White House make it a practice to put out statements condemning random barely viewed YouTube videos? The White House officially endorses that cute video of Kooky82s cat attempting to meow the national anthem.The embassys statement was obviously responding to something and if anyone in the administration -- even that rogue embassy official! -- knew the Internet video was upsetting our dear Muslim friends why on earth werent our embassies protected?Next the Obama administration detained the American filmmaker and asked Google to block the allegedly offending video. (Take the week off First Amendment.)This behavior made it difficult for even the most obsequious journalist to keep railing against Romney for suggesting that Obama was acquiescing to angry Muslims. So the NFMs harangue against Romney was deposited in the same filing cabinet where the paperwork to close Gitmo is currently stored.Now a week later Romney has said something again. (Damn him!) This provoked another round of hysterical denunciations from the media.At a private gathering Romney told donors that Obama had a lock on the 47 percent of voters who pay no income tax and believe the government has a responsibility to care for them. This was deeply offensive to people who pay no income tax and believe the government has a responsibility to care for them.But no matter how much the media belch out the usual cliches -- out of touch insensitive racist not one of us Thurston Howell etc. etc. -- all most people heard was: FORTY-SEVEN PERCENT OF AMERICANS PAY NO INCOME TAX?A friend of mine who spent time in Russia during the 70s told me that whenever a Russian would bring up the extensive coverage of Watergate hed sigh thinking hed have to explain that the American political system was not as corrupt as the commissars would have it. But all they ever wanted to ask him was: Do all Americans have such nice shoes?The lesson is: You cant always control what the audience notices.Thanks to the myopia of our one-party media most journalists are firmly convinced that voters will be appalled by Romneys description of 47 percent of Americans as supporting Obama because they pay no income tax. (Yes head-up-their-butts journalists in the charming little burg of Manhattan are complaining that Romney isnt connecting with ordinary people.)But the only people shocked by Romneys statement of fact are those who would never vote Republican under any circumstances. Everyone else is saying Is it really as high as 47 percent? -- as the media impotently shouts No you idiot! Thats not the point!Theres going to come a time in the not-distant future when its 51 percent paying no income tax. And when that happens the party of big government will never lose another election. America will become indistinguishable from Western European nanny states -- except there will be no America to protect us.The media happen to love the party of big government with all their heart so from now until the election no matter what Romney says they plan to be scandalized.COPYRIGHT 2012 ANN COULTER	3	3	2	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	3	1	3	3

TONOPAH Nev. (AP) � Several emergency responders have been stung after a flatbed truck carrying honeybees rolled over in rural Nevada.Authorities say 66-year-old truck driver Rudy Breneman had been hauling a load of bees from Bruce S.D. to California when he pulled to the side of the highway east of Tonopah � about 200 miles northwest of Las Vegas � on Monday afternoon.Breneman told troopers the big rig started sinking into the soft dirt of the shoulder and eventually tipped over breaking open many of the hives.State troopers sheriffs deputies and firefighters all were stung.Trooper Wes Hubred says he was stung seven times.Troopers say firefighters tried to contain the bees with water before beekeepers arrived.Breneman wasnt injured in the accident and is not being cited.	5	4	5	4	4	3	3	2	4	1	2	1	1	3	3
NASHVILLE Tenn. (AP) � Emmylou Harris loves Mumford & Sons for a special reason.Theyre making the banjo respectable which is not an easy feat and Im so glad its finally happening Harris joked.Harris an iconic singer and member of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Mumford & Sons platinum-selling lads from London who have sparked a folk rock resurgence are joining together to explore their shared love of high harmony sad songs and yes the oft-belittled banjo on an episode of CMT Crossroads on Thursday night.The Nashville-based Harris had only briefly met lead singer Marcus Mumford before agreeing to do the show based on the waves they created in the music world. They coordinated song choices by phone and got together to rehearse for a little more than a day before recording the show earlier this month.It was a crash course in catalog consumption and the chance to get to know each other.Theyre great harmony (singers) and theyve got this great driving groove with a minimalist instrumentation Harris said. But they just sound good and the songs have beautiful melodies and I love harmonizing on them.She said it proves her theory that music is going to keep reinventing itself in good ways.You dont have to repeat the past. We learn from the past but we have to come forward with something different and there are just so many different combinations to make good music that touches people she said.Harris 65 was among the gateway artists who helped Mumford and bandmates Ben Lovett Ted Dwane and Winston Marshall discover their love for American roots music. It started with the O Brother Where Art Thou? soundtrack. Harris appeared with Gillian Welch and Alison Krauss on the memorable song Didnt Leave Nobody but the Baby. That eventually led them to the Old Crow Medicine Show and then deep immersion in old-timey sounds from Americas long-neglected past.They ran across Harris imprint many times along the way and with the help of dobro master Jerry Douglas they help explore that legacy on the show.Pretty much every song that Emmylou has sung on is my favorite song of whichever artist she sang with Mumford said. Im like an obsessive Emmylou Harris freak and Im not ashamed.In turn the quartet has helped shine a light on the influence Harris and the extensive roots underground still exerts. The band which releases their new album Babel this week were a growing success story in that community when they appeared on the 2011 Grammy Awards with Bob Dylan and the Avett Brothers launching Mumford & Sons into the national popular consciousness. Their album Sigh No More is now double platinum and Babel is one of the years most anticipated albums.For us its kind of a bit of a dream come true Dwane said. Wed never thought wed get to travel so extensively meet our heroes and collaborate with so many people. ... Were just having a really nice time.Like the band fans have discovered something new in those old sounds. Mumford & Sons routinely drew 10000 and more fans on their Gentleman of the Road tour across the U.S. this summer almost all of them dancing along to Marshalls banjo.Folk music has always been there but its wonderful to see the infusion of freshness and energy but still having that passion Harris said. Not just mimicking what went before but infusing it. I was joking about the banjo but Im serious.___Online:http://emmylouharris.comhttp://mumfordandsons.com___For the latest country music news from the Associated Press: http://twitter.com/AP_Country.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe moved a step closer to loosening Russias grip on European Union energy supplies after Italy Albania and Greece signed an agreement supporting the construction of a pipeline to deliver gas from Azerbaijan.At a ceremony in New York on Thursday the three countries signed a memorandum of understanding bringing the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) closer to reality although building was not likely to commence until 2014 or 2015.The deal improves TAPs chances against Nabucco West the other remaining contender in the race to become the first pipeline to deliver Azeri gas to Europe diversifying the supply. Nabucco West would run from the Turkish border via a northerly gas hub in Austria while TAP would link to Europe via Italy.TAPs managing director Kjetil Tungland called the agreement a testament to TAPs commercial and technical strengths and the European commissioner for energy Guenther Oettinger said it represented a significant breakthrough.This is another important step towards our aim to get gas directly from the Caspian region Oettinger said on Friday.Nabucco West spokesman Christian Dolezal said Nabucco still had the most advanced legal framework and therefore remained in a strong position to challenge TAP. We consider this a benchmark in the Southern Corridor he said.BID TO DIVERSIFY SUPPLIESThe Southern Corridor is the Commissions name for whichever project is selected to help wean the continent off its dependence on Russia which supplies more than 30 percent of all EU gas imports including nearly 100 percent in six EU states.Tension between the European Union and Russia over energy has flared repeatedly and worsened since the Commission the EUs executive announced this month that it was investigating suspected anti-competitive practices by Gazprom  Russia state-controlled gas monopoly.In its bid for diversification the Commission says it does not favor any particular project insisting that its aim is only to make gas supplies more secure and competitive.Whether TAP or Nabucco West wins depends on the consortium of companies that operates the Azeri field that will supply the gas known as Shah Deniz II.The consortium led by BP  Statoil  Socar Total and ENI  is expected to take a decision over the coming months on which of the routes to link up with.TAPs shareholders are EGL AG of Switzerland (42.5 percent) Norways Statoil (42.5 percent) and E.ON Ruhrgas of Germany (15 percent) .Analysts have said a weakness of the project is its lack of Italian partners. Some argue a pipeline into Italy would never secure political backing without an Italian company as investor.For its part the Italian government is seeking to turn Italy into a southern European gas hub in an effort to reduce energy prices which are among the highest in Europe and damaging Italian companies at a time of economic crisis.Nabuccos six shareholders are Austrias OMV AG  Germanys RWE AG  Hungarys MOL through its gas pipeline operator FGSZ Turkeys Botas BEH of Bulgaria and Romanias Transgaz .(Additional reporting by Stephen Jewkes in Milan editing by James Jukwey)	4	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	2	3	1	1	1	3
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Creation of a banking union to help resolve the euro zone debt crisis could lead to a split within the wider European Union lawmakers in the European Parliament warned during a debate that laid bare the extent of tensions in the bloc.Brussels proposed earlier this month that the European Central Bank (ECB) take charge of supervising all banks in the euro currency zone as a first step towards creating a banking union under which euro zone countries would eventually jointly back their lenders.However the plan has sparked concerns among the 10 EU countries which do not use the euro that they will be indirectly affected by the ECBs new supervisory powers and put at a competitive disadvantage whether they join the scheme or not.Legally the European Parliament will have no say in writing much of the legislation for a banking union. But it has powers to amend other important financial regulations and can exert influence to change or even delay the new regime.Whats the point of having a single supervisory mechanism (for the euro zone) when you have the UK with its 60 percent of the financial market not involved? said Werner Langen a German lawmaker in the debate on Wednesday.Instead of a single supervisory mechanism we have a division of Europe a very explosive division.Langens views were echoed throughout the debate of the parliaments influential economic and monetary affairs committee where members from around Europe voiced conflicting views about the shape of a banking union.What we dont want to do here is split the EU down the middle said Wolf Klinz a German member of parliament. What we dont want to see is that the British push themselves into a corner where they have a referendum and they say ... thats enough for us.BETTER CONTROLA banking union which would aim to restore confidence in an industry that has been battered by crisis for nearly five years has three major steps: the ECB takes over monitoring euro zone banks and others that sign up a single fund is created to close down and settle the debts of failed banks and a comprehensive scheme to protect savers deposits is established.As well as building the foundation for better control of banks the union would be important because it should allow the euro zones rescue fund the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to directly inject much-needed capital into banks such as those in Spain.We are under time pressure said Sven Giegold a German member of the parliament who also flagged concerns about a two-tier scheme damaging those countries on the outside. The banking union ... is linked to access to the ESM.This pledge made by euro zone leaders in June appears to be unraveling however after Germany the Netherlands and Finland drew a distinction between future banking problems and legacy difficulties - which could mean that problem banks in Spain and Ireland remain the states responsibility.This proposal is to allow for the direct recapitalization of Spanish banks because Spain doesnt want to put in a normal application (for aid) said Langen who is a member of the CDU the same political party as German Chancellor Angela Merkel.The whole European system of banking supervision is being turned on its head for the sake of Spain. As this thing has been turned on its head we need to turn it back again Langen said.SUPERVISORY REACHThe debate underscored a central problem of the union - that it could drive a wedge between those countries inside the scheme and those outside whose banks may suffer as a result.Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg has said he would not accept ECB oversight of Nordea  the Nordic regions biggest bank as long as his country remains outside a banking union. Nordea has its headquarters outside the euro zone in Stockholm but has major operations in Finland the sole Nordic country to use the common currency.While Britain will stay outside the scheme many international banks in London - ranging from HSBC to Citi - have operations in the euro zone that will be affected by the ECBs new supervisory reach.London is worried that the ECB emboldened by its new powers will demand regulation that could undermine the citys position as Europes financial capital.Some believe that the European Banking Authority (EBA) set up to coordinate the supervision of banks in response to the financial crisis and which is run by regulators from across the European Union could act as a counterbalance.The European Commission has already suggested a special voting mechanism among EU regulators as a counterweight to the power of those in the euro zone.Countries should be lured in tempted in - it should be made difficult for a country to refuse said Giegold who will play a leading role in talks about the plan.The system should be so attractive that everyone will want to join Giegold said in an appeal which is likely to be ignored in London.The close ties between some troubled governments and the banks they supervise - and on which they also rely to buy their debt - have dragged both ever-deeper into crisis.A banking union would break this link by making the policing of banks supranational and establishing central schemes paid into collectively to cover the costs of closing failed lenders and protecting savers deposits.(Editing by David Stamp and David Holmes)	2	2	2	2	3	3	4	3	3	4	2	2	1	4	2
It�s a professional referee�s job to ensure that games run smoothly so its perhaps no surprise that the absence of refs from this seasons NFL games � thanks to contract disputes between the league and the referees union � has led to almost unprecedented chaos. After three weeks of controversial calls which culminated in a game-changing decision in a matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers on Monday news outlets have reported that the referees and the NFL are close to signing a deal. As the lockout approaches its end its worth looking back at how it began. What is the dispute about? Who should be blamed? And what does it mean for the future of the football season? Here everything you need to know about the NFLs referee lockout:What are the NFL and the referees fighting about?There are several areas of disagreement but the biggest sticking point is money. The referees want to stick with a pension plan that was originally negotiated in 2006 the NFL wants to implement a 401(k) plan instead. The NFLs refusal to budge has puzzled many analysts because the cost differential between the pension and the 401(k) is relatively small: Roughly .33 percent of the leagues annual $10 billion revenue or $100000 per team per season � a figure some commentators have called the equivalent of a rounding error for the NFL.Who did the NFL hire to replace the locked-out referees?A group of less-experienced officials culled from smaller markets like the Arena Football League Divisions II and III of the NCAA and � in one particularly damning case � the Lingerie Football League (LFL) a far-from-professional league in which women play the game in bras and panties. Fans and commentators have expressed both frustration with this solution and sympathy for the stand-in refs inexperience.What do the NFL players think?The vast majority have sided with the referees. Many players have spoken of their exasperation in post-game interviews or taken to Twitter voicing complaints like I thought I was watching Punkd and calling the use of replacements a slap in the face.What do sportswriters think?Theyre furious. The NFL used to be the Mona Lisa says Rick Reilly at ESPN.com rather grandly and the referees strike is painting a mustache on it. This may not be the worst mistake a commissioner has made in my lifetime but it is surely the dumbest adds Michael Rosenberg at Sports Illustrated. The general consensus: The NFL has seriously damaged its integrity and put its players at risk to save money that it would barely even notice was gone.Has the lockout hurt the NFL?In reputation yes in revenue no. Despite widespread criticism from fans and players neither viewership nor attendance has declined. In fact the debate over the Seahawks-Packers game has drawn much attention to the NFL leading many analysts to conclude that NFL ratings will be up next weekend � if only due to perverse curiosity � which may be why the league hasnt seemed to be in a hurry to cut a deal.Will the lockout really end soon?Reports are mixed. According to ESPN.com an agreement in principle is ready and the remaining points of contention are minor enough that locked-out officials may even be on the field again by Sunday. But the Los Angeles Times countered quoting an inside source that says a deal is not as close as has been reported.SEE MORE: Peyton Mannings underwhelming Broncos debut: 4 talking pointsView this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	4	4	2	3	3	3	2	2	4	3	4	3	1	2	3

LUCKNOW India (Reuters) - As a former wrestler Mulayam Singh Yadav has got Indias government where he likes it - in a vice-like grip.The ructions over fresh economic reforms that reduced the ruling coalition to a parliamentary minority last month left Prime Minister Manmohan Singh dependent on this wheeler-dealer from the countrys dusty northern plains.In an interview with Reuters Yadav insisted there were no strings attached to his support for Singhs Congress party just a desire to keep the opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of power.We are supporting them he said in the Hindi language looking hearty for his 72 years despite rumors earlier this year that his health was failing. There are no conditions of any kind its only to ensure communal forces do not get strengthened.However Yadav is at least as well known for his maneuvering as he was in his youth for pinning opponents down in a wrestling bout: Congress party leaders know he cannot be trusted to stick with them through thick and thin - and few are convinced when he denies any ambition to one day become prime minister.For now the 22 lawmakers of Yadavs Samajwadi (Socialist) Party will side with the government ensuring it can muster the 272 votes needed in parliament to prevent its collapse. Their support became crucial after another regional party leader left the coalition angry over hikes in the price of subsidized fuel and a decision to open Indias doors to foreign supermarket giants.Yadavs take on the reforms is that he opposes them but will nevertheless continue to support the government. We will oppose anything that goes against the interests of the people he said. But we will not allow the government to fall.A FAMILY BUSINESSYadav was born to a rural family in Uttar Pradesh Indias most populous state with 200 million people and - since it sends more lawmakers to Delhi than any other - its politically most important.As a young man he trained as a wrestler before being attracted to socialism and local politics eventually becoming chief minister of the state three times and federal defense minister in a coalition government during the 1990s.Six months ago when his Samajwadi Party returned to power in Uttar Pradesh after a hiatus Yadav stood aside for his son Akhilesh to head the state government. That and what was perhaps a bout of ill-health set off reports he was seriously ill and no longer well enough to hold office.I am fine Yadav said at his sprawling colonial bungalow in Lucknow capital of Uttar Pradesh. Impeccably dressed in the starched white dhoti-kurta of the region and his salt-and-pepper hair still damp from a mid-morning bath he showed few signs of age as he strode out from under the porch of his home chatting with aides and party colleagues.Those were just rumors. I went on the campaign trail and I am fine now.In India where caste and family play hugely important roles in politics the Yadavs have several advantages. They are from a land-owning lower caste whose members were mostly subsistence farmers and cattle herders but have become wealthier more politically aware and socially assertive in recent decades.Yadav his daughter-in-law Dimple a cousin and a nephew are in the federal parliament. A brother is in the Uttar Pradesh state government headed by Akhilesh.On the negative side the party is anathema for other lower caste groups. Critics also say it is tarred by association with people who have criminal pasts and previous Samajwadi Party rule in Uttar Pradesh brought rampant corruption and increased violence.The other family firmly entrenched in Indian politics is the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has ruled the country for a majority of the years since independence in 1947 and also looks on Uttar Pradesh as its base.Akhilesh is often compared to the scion of that dynasty Rahul Gandhi whose Congress party was burned by the Samajwadi win in the Uttar Pradesh elections earlier this year. He dismisses talk of rivalry or probable cooperation.He is a new leader a nice man a youth leader Akhilesh said in a separate interview. We are of the same age. His party should give him an opportunity.INDIAS NEXT PRIME MINISTER?Although the Congress party-led coalition could coax other parties to keep it alive for now it is dependent on Mulayam Singh Yadav who is widely expected to demand a pound of flesh despite his professed unconditional support.News reports have said he will press for an illegal wealth case against him to be dropped and for impoverished Uttar Pradesh to get more federal aid.Longer term Yadav could be preparing to form a Third Front government an amalgam of smaller parties that keeps out both Congress and BJP after national elections due by mid-2014.Analysts and voter surveys suggest no clear winner will emerge in those polls meaning the Third Front may well have the parliamentary numbers to stake a claim to power.Since Yadavs party won Uttar Pradesh with a large majority odds are he will have enough lawmakers in parliament after the 2014 elections to put him in pole position to form a coalition and to head it.Asked if Yadav could become prime minister Sudha Pai a political scientist who is rector at New Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University said: He knows how to make a deal how to get on with other political parties. He is very good at negotiating he is the traditional Indian politician.Yadav dismisses such ambitions: I have never been a candidate for prime ministership and I am not now he said.But the murmurs in his party where he is called Netaji or leader are growing.No political party has a leader who is from a village or is a farmer said Samajwadi Party spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary. This is a nation of villagers and farmers and Netaji represents 70 percent of the country.THE YOUNGER YADAVThe Samajwadi Party which is more or less restricted to Uttar Pradesh cannot expect to get anything near a parliamentary majority on its own but its workers say it can clinch up to 60 of the states 80 parliamentary seats.It could be joined by other regional parties and left-wing groups and even a section of the Congress party could be won over to cobble a majority analysts say.Akhilesh the son and new chief minister says governing Uttar Pradesh is as important to him as increasing numbers in parliament.Its not enough to say that because we won the state elections so well we will get more MPs he said. I have to perform and if people believe that my government has performed well then the result will be good.My priority is Uttar Pradesh said the 39-year-old a contrast at least on the surface to his politician father.The younger Yadav speaks fluent English is tech-savvy and studied in Australia. He was trained as an environment engineer and was once a keen footballer and Manchester United supporter. Now he says politics consume him almost completely.If we go to the center Netaji will go there (and) some of our senior leadership but I am happy in the state he said adding the party was not looking to topple Prime Minister Singh.His father is similarly cautious.In 2014 Samajwadi will fight on its own strength there will be no understanding with anyone he said. After the elections things (alliances) happen nothing happens before. Depending on the circumstances we will take decisions then.(Editing by John Chalmers and Dean Yates)	3	3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	3
Facebook (FB) knows it can�t keep growing without generating new revenue streams and Reuters reports that the social networking giant may have found some potentially significant ones if it can get businesses to pay for its Offers service. Facebook Offers which launched earlier this year has so far been a free service that lets businesses send out special deals and coupons to their followers on Facebook. But Reuters says that within the next month Facebook �will require merchants to pay at least $5 on related ads to promote each Facebook Offer to a targeted audience of fans and friends of fans.�Facebook will also open up its Offers to online-only businesses meaning that companies will no longer need to have a physical location to participate in the service. Reuters says that Facebook decided to start charging for Offers due to pressure from investors who have been unhappy so far with the company�s declining stock price.�We think this aligns incentives nicely� Gokul Rajaram Facebook�s advertising director of product management told Reuters. �The requirement to pay for related ads will focus merchants on who and where they want the offer to reach.�ReadGet more from BGR.com: Follow us on Twitter Facebook	2	2	3	3	2	3	2	3	3	3	3	2	2	1	3

BERLIN (AP) � The leaders of France and Germany both stressed Saturday that Europe must further deepen its political and economic integration to ensure peace and continuous prosperity across the continent.French President Francois Hollande met Chancellor Angela Merkel in the southwestern German city of Ludwigsburg to celebrate an important anniversary of their countries reconciliation following the end of World War II.France and Germany have a very special responsibility we form the heart of Europe said Hollande adding that the European Unions status quo can only be seen as the starting point for a deeper integration.Stopping would mean falling back. We dont have a choice but to march toward the destiny that is ours march toward a unified Europe he added.Europes 17-nation currency zone is experiencing a deep crisis Hollande said therefore urging Germany and other nations to help create instruments that make us stronger: the budgetary union the banking union the social union a political union.Merkel said both countries will and must work together closely to strengthen Europe to weather those new challenges.However great the economic challenges may be. It remains and will remain valid: We Europeans are united in the pursuit of our happiness she said.Frances then-leader Charles de Gaulle in 1962 addressed German youth in Ludwigsburg � speaking in German � in a speech that was hailed as a major step toward building German-French ties after the nations had fought each other in both world wars and were often referred to as arch-enemies.De Gaulle and his German counterpart Konrad Adenauer started the reconciliation efforts in the aftermath of World War II.Merkel said the two leaders who had witnessed themselves the horrors of war laid the foundation of Europes unification in bringing together their nations who were long said to be arch-enemies � what a terrible word. They were convinced that natural enmity between people could not exist she added.The two countries rapprochement evolved to become a motor of Europes integration less than two decades after World War II. France and Germany representing almost half of the eurozones economic output are still seen as key players in forging European policies.Addressing the youth of both nations Hollande concluded his speech in German saying it is now your role to make the European dream a reality and give it a future.___Juergen Baetz can be reached on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jbaetz	4	4	4	3	4	3	2	3	3	1	2	2	2	2	4
MEDINAH Illinois Sept 30 (Reuters) - Three of the four American rookies who seized the Ryder Cup spotlight with their fearless play slipped into the shadows during the decisive singles on Sunday as Europe claimed a shock victory.Webb Simpson Brandt Snedeker and Keegan Bradley became instant Ryder Cup darlings with their dazzling debut in the opening foursomes and fourballs on Friday but were mostly invisible on Sunday as Europe stormed back from a 10-6 deficit to take the trophy.The first-timers who had formed the backbone of the Americans 5-3 first day lead and made significant contributions on day two failed to deliver in the last day pressure cooker with Jason Dufner the only rookie to record a win beating Swedens Peter Hanson two up.Its hard not to get up in front of these fans with so much at stake in the singles Dufner told reporters. I made a couple of nice putts there that kind of got me fired up a little bit.Excited to get that point for the team.Bradley had led the American Ryder Cup team forming an electrifying partnership with Phil Mickelson that generated three points from three matches but on their own both came up short on Sunday.Bradley absorbed his first Ryder Cup loss falling 2&1 to world number one Rory McIlroy while Mickelson lost one down to Justin Rose in his 38th Ryder Cup match the most by an American in the biennial competition.Before the Europeans had popped the corks on their champagne the post-mortem on the 14-1/2 to 13-1/2 loss had begun with Love being quizzed about his move to sit down the red-hot Bradley and Mickelson from Saturdays fourball that may have cost his team a valuable point.In hindsight we would have done a lot of things differently I guess said Love. These guys asked to do certain things during the week and there are some guys that didnt want to sit out but guys that felt like they needed to rest we let them rest.Im going to second guess myself for a long time. Could have done a lot of things differently.One thing Love will not regret is having four rookies on his squad Bradley (3-1-0) Dufner (3-1-0) Simpson (2-2-0) and Snedeker (1-2-0) combining to contribute nine points to the U.S. cause.In fact it was the senior members of the team who failed to hold up their end Jim Furyk (1-2-0) Steve Stricker (0-4-0) and Tiger Woods (0-3-1) managing just one-and-a-half points between them.I tried to remind the guys a little bit yesterday even after the third session that the tournament was not even halfway over yet point wise said Love. We had a long way to go.We tried to not focus on results but we talked about it a little bit last night that all we could do was just go out play one match at a time everybody go out and have fun try to win their point.Im sure theres a lot of great plans in a lot of sporting events that sound really good the night before before the game starts and then theres a fumble or a turnover or something happens and it doesnt work.What didnt work today is they played a little bit better than us and got some momentum and made it tough.

The trailer for the film Innocence of Muslims recently led to riots over its depiction of the prophet Muhammad as a womanizer child molester and criminal. Several Americans including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens were killed in protests that have been linked to the film.Despite the outrage its not clear that the film actually exists certainly a trailer for it does but a trailer isnt a film. Investigation into the anti-Muslim film is ongoing but as yet there seems to be no evidence that the film exists other than as a deadly hoax. People create hoaxes for many reasons but when fraud mixes with religious fervor the results can range from the comical to the deadly.Heres a look at seven religious hoaxes throughout history.1. The Protocols of the Elders of ZionPerhaps the most infamous and malicious religious hoax in history The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion is a book supposedly revealing a secret Jewish conspiracy to take over the world. It first appeared in Russia in 1905 and though the book has been completely discredited as a forgery it is still in print and remains widely circulated.Many people have endorsed this religious hoax including actor Mel Gibson Adolf Hitler and automaker Henry Ford who in 1920 paid to have a half-million copies of the book published. [Top 10 Conspiracy Theories]2. The Shroud of Turin and Other Holy RelicsThough many believe that Italys Shroud of Turin is the burial shroud of Jesus theres compelling evidence the shroud is in fact a hoax including a 1389 letter from French Bishop Pierre dArcisto Pope Clement stating that a painter confessed to creating it. Indeed the Bishops evidence was so convincing that even Pope Clement acknowledged it as a forgery � one of countless faked religious relics circulating at the time. Carbon dating of the Shroud of Turin revealed it does not date back to the time of Christ but instead 14 centuries later � exactly when the forger confessed to making it. Even more damning for its authenticity there is no record of its existence before then if it really is the burial shroud of Jesus Christ it seems suspicious that no one knew anything about it for 1300 years. Though many remain convinced of its authenticity the historical and scientific evidence suggest the Shroud of Turin is probably a religious hoax. As researcher Joe Nickell noted in his book Relics of the Christ (The University Press of Kentucky 2007)the shroud on display in Turin is only one of over 40 such Jesus shrouds � all claimed to be the real one. [Who Was Jesus the Man?]3. The Cardiff GiantWhen farm workers digging a well in Cardiff N.Y. uncovered a fossilized man in 1869 they found something remarkable. The Cardiff Giant as the figure became known was a somewhat realistic figure with roughly human dimensions � except that it was nearly 10 feet tall. It was clearly something unique � but what exactly it was divided the public. Some believed it was a stone carving but who would have made it so long ago that it was buried so deep in the ground? Others including a local reverend were convinced it was proof of the literal truth of Biblical scripture specifically Genesis 6:4 (There were giants in the earth in those days KJV). Here finally was one of those Biblical giants discovered on a rural New York farm! It was in fact a clever hoax by a man named George Hull who had planted the carved stone where it would later be found by the farm hands partly to prove the Bible literalists wrong.4. Indian Guru Sai Babas LegerdemainOne of the most influential spiritual leaders in India Satya Sai Baba died last year at the age of 84. For over five decades the charismatic guru enthralled and mystified followers by performing minor miracles including producing holy ash watches statues necklaces and rings seemingly out of thin air. However skeptical investigators including Basava Premanand of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations accused Sai Baba of simple magicians tricks and pointed out that all the objects were small and easily concealed in his hands and long-sleeved robes. In at least one case Sai Baba was caught on film by British investigator Professor Richard Wiseman secretly pulling small objects from his person while pretending they appeared out of nowhere.5. The Discovery of Noahs ArkThose seeking to find archaeological and historical proof of events in the Bible have often looked for � and some claim even found � Noahs Ark. Though many claims of finding the ark are honest mistakes in 1993 a man hoaxed CBS television into running atwo-hour primetime special titled The Incredible Discovery of Noahs Ark. It featured a man named George Jammal who claimed to have found the ark on a mountain in Turkey. As proof of his incredible claim he proudly displayed a piece of wood from the ark it was in fact scrap pine marinated in soy sauce and Jammal was an actor who had never even been to Turkey.6. The Ossuary of James Brother of JesusIn 2002 an antiquities dealer in Israel claimed to have discovered a limestone ossuary (used to hold bones of the dead) with an inscription in Aramaic on one side of the box identifying its (missing) contents as those of James Son of Joseph Brother of Jesus. The find made international news because if genuine it might provide archaeological evidence for Jesus Christ. However many archaeologists were skeptical for several reasons including that there was no clear provenance (history) for the item and because carved rosette patterns on the other side of the box were rounded from age and decay while the script on the disputed inscription had sharp edges suggesting it was recently added. A chalk wash also appeared to have been added to the lettering to make it appear older than it actually was. In 2003 the Israeli Antiquities Authority published a report concluding that the inscription was a modern forgery carved on a genuinely old ossuary box. [Faux Real: A Gallery of Forgeries]7. God Speaks to Peter Popoff Via Short-Wave RadioOne of the most prominent televangelists in the 1980s was Peter Popoff who during his services and revivals would call out names and home addresses of audience members hed never met. He even knew personal details such as family members illnesses or their deceased loved ones names. It seemed that Popoff got his messages from God or angels and it greatly impressed his audiences and followers.In 1986 magician James The Amazing Randi heard about Popoffs amazing abilities and decided to investigate. Randi noticed an apparently minor detail that most people missed: Popoff was wearing a hearing aid or earpiece. Using a radio scanner Randi discovered that Popoff was actually getting biographical information about audience members from his wife (who had earlier spoken to the audience) using a short-wave radio. The scandal tarnished Popoffs ministry but he eventually recovered and remains active today.Benjamin Radford is deputy editor of Skeptical Inquirer science magazine and author of Scientific Paranormal Investigation: How to Solve Unexplained Mysteries.

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A study of nearly 190000 young women injected with Merck & Cos human papillomavirus vaccine Gardasil found no new safety concerns.Researchers said the only side effects they observed - rare cases of skin infections and fainting - were benign and expected.This analysis was very reassuring said lead researcher Dr. Nicola Klein of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in Oakland California whose work was funded by Merck.HPV vaccination is recommended for both boys and girls to shield them from the sexually transmitted infection which may cause various types of cancer.While Gardasil has already been deemed safe and effective by health regulators across the globe large follow-up studies are typically required after vaccines hit the market to make sure less-common side effects havent been missed.Kleins team studied girls and women ages 9 to 26 who had had at least one Gardasil shot between 2006 and 2008. Based on electronic records they compared ER visits and hospitalizations soon after vaccination and several months later when short-term side effects would no longer be expected to show up.Three doses of Gardasil the recommended amount cost about $360. U.S. health regulators have found no serious side effects apart from soreness at the injection site.At first glance several health conditions appeared to be linked to the vaccination including seizures allergic reactions and birth defects in vaccine recipients.A special safety committee without ties to Merck concluded that most of these conditions were not truly caused by the vaccine however but rather unrelated or preexisting conditions detected when the shot was given.All of a sudden these things get brought up again said Klein but it has absolutely nothing to do with the vaccination.After reviewing medical records for a number of different conditions that might be linked to the vaccine the researchers determined that only two of them were legitimate findings.In the two weeks after getting the vaccine there were 1.8 cases of skin infections per 10000 women compared to just one case per two weeks per 10000 women months away from the vaccination.And some of those infections might simply have been red swellings at the injection site said Klein whose findings are published in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine.A STRESS REACTION?On the day of the vaccination the rate of fainting was six times higher than usual. But again the risk was very low and has been seen before in other vaccine studies Klein said.Its possible that fainting may be a stress reaction to the injection itself according to Dr. Michael Brady an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Nationwide Childrens Hospital in Columbus Ohio.He said adolescents should sit down for 15 minutes after getting a shot as also advised by health officials.If they do fall and hit their head it can have consequences so its not something to be ignored added Brady who was not involved in the new work and has no ties to HPV vaccine makers.Overall he said the study didnt bring up any unexpected concerns.The combination of a vaccine that is working and is safe should make people feel comfortable Brady added.Gardasil is expected to prevent more than 90 percent of genital warts and between 60 and 70 percent of cervical cancers according to Dr. Christopher Harrison of Childrens Mercy Hospitals and Clinics in Kansas City Missouri.The risk benefit here is clearly and resoundingly in favor of the vaccine being much more beneficial than risky said Harrison who was not linked to the new study and has not had any relationship to Merck for the past three years.SOURCE: http://bit.ly/SYxece Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine online October 1 2012.	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	2	1	1	3
PARIS (Reuters) - The European Court of Human Rights on Monday gave final approval for one of Britains most radical Islamist clerics Abu Hamza al-Masri to be extradited to the United States with four others to be tried for terrorism.The Egyptian-born cleric filed an appeal along with the four other suspects after the court in Strasbourg authorized Britain to transfer him to the United States on charges that he supported al Qaeda and aided a fatal kidnapping in Yemen.Al-Masri 54 could face a sentence of over 100 years in an ultra-secure Supermax prison and had argued that such treatment would contravene Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights which prohibits inhumane and degrading treatment.Today the Grand Chamber decided to reject the request. This means that the Chamber judgment of April 10 2012 is now final the ECHR said in a statement.The decision also concerned appeals lodged by four other defendants Babar Ahmad Syed Tahla Ahsan Adel Abdul Bary and Khaled Al-Fawwaz all of whom have been detained in Britain pending extradition to the United States.A spokesperson for Britains Home Office welcomed the outcome adding that Britain would work to ensure that all five individuals were handed over to U.S. authorities as quickly as possible.Al-Masri is one of the most radical Islamists in Britain where he was once a preacher at a North London mosque but was later convicted of inciting murder and racial hatred. He is being held in a British jail.He was indicted in 2004 by a federal grand jury in New York accused of providing material support to al Qaeda and of involvement in a hostage taking in Yemen in 1998 in which four hostages were killed.

PARIS (AP) � Coco Chanel once said: The most courageous act is still to think for yourself.Day five of Paris Fashion Week did not lose sight of the legendary fashion designers words.Saturday presented a gold mine of eclectic and individual shows each with a unique stamp of their designer.London-based Vivienne Westwood led the crowd celebrating Queen Elizabeth IIs Diamond Jubilee but travelling � as she did � via Japan Russia Spain and Africa.Westwood is the only designer on the Paris fashion calendar � or perhaps anywhere � who can cross the globe and several centuries mixing up Bangkok-style catwomen Chinese tea prints tropical cowboys Velasquez peasants the Ballets Russes and still produce a coherent and unified show.Viktor & Rolf meanwhile went back to their signature plays on oversized proportion to produce a glitzy show � as they prepare to celebrate 20 years since they founded the label.The epitome of femininity Cacharel explored spring through the natural colors of mother nature in a trademark delicate display.Sundays shows include Kenzo Celine and Hermes.___VIVIENNE WESTWOODGlobal exotic is how English designer Vivienne Westwood described her brilliant and wacky spring-summer 2013 show hosted on terra mater in Paris British Embassy.Disparate encyclopedia fashion references amazingly gelled together owing to her unique eccentricity.Westwood cited Sergei Diaghilevs Ballets Russes � the early 20th centurys most famous ballet company � as a key inspiration.The influential troupe used exotic styles with billowing trousers and turbans � which was evoked in many of the baggy globe-trotting looks.One of the nicest looks came in a series of modified Japanese kimonos.One in light gray silk with wide bateau collar had fluttering hoop panels that fluttered by.Above all else Westwood � whos 71 � has lost none of her humor.There was a special guest star � a model portraying Queen Elizabeth II. She clutched a handbag in a crown and demure gray silk dress. In this cameo unlike in the Olympic Games opening ceremony in which a queen look-a-like parachuted into the main stadium the model just walked in through the embassy door.___VIKTOR & ROLFViktor & Rolf were feeling reflective looking back on almost two decades since founding their fashion house and that was evident Saturday in their oversized spring-summer ode to 70s pleated glamor.We were in a reflective mood... said Viktor Horsting one half of the famed Dutch design duo which is approaching its 20th anniversary.Not ones to normally take things quite so literally the inseparable Viktor and Rolf channeled mirrors in their oversized spring-summer ode to 70s pleated glamor.The designers who founded their Amsterdam-based fashion house in 1993 sent models through a reflective tunnel onto a catwalk wearing mainly black white and silver ensembles that featured blinding mirror appliques on sumptuous silks.Oversized proportion � a signature mark � produced some hits.Giant bows in soft pink and purple were used high or low on the waist to sumptuous effect.But there were some small misses in proportion too: One tubular floor-length skirt had rose-shaped mirror appliques whose size competed with the models head.___CACHARELCacharel perfectly captured the fresh mood of spring in a feminine collection � typical of the popular French house � that brought aquatic life to the catwalk.Free hanging A-line slip dress and gently flaring peplums and skirts Saturday floated alongside prints of goldfish skin anemones and underwater tea flower bloom.This spring-summer 2013 collection was also a celebration of the natural world in its careful palette the Cerulean blue of sky orange of sea coral and tea green.But perhaps nature is in the house DNA: After all designer Jean Bousquet who founded the house in 1962 named it after a small beautifully striped dabbling duck with the same name.Todays designers Ling Liu and Dawei Sun keep these codes therefore adding this season a touch of contemporary graphic prints.The gentle blurring made this collection a visual treat.___MARTIN GRANTAustralian Martin Grant is not a household name but he has a solid reputation in the fashion world and a string of celebrity followers like Juliette Binoche Kate Hudson and Cate Blanchett.Saturdays clean and on-trend collection proves its little wonder.I wanted to play with volumes Grant said backstage referring to the many looks which had elongated peplums and jacket-skirts twinned with black shorts � seen in Raf Simons show for Dior.Black and navy was used well in A-line with trapeze silhouettes and accentuated midriff � one of the big parts of this seasons fashion conversation � nicely nipped the silhouettes.One of the colors of the season vermilion was used perfectly as shards of color or completely covering dresses.___Thomas Adamson can be followed at http:/ /Twitter.com/ThomasAdamsonAP	3	3	3	3	4	3	1	4	3	3	3	4	4	1	3
PRESIDENT OBAMA SUMMONED the top four congressional leaders to the White House on Saturday morning July 23 2011. The night before House Speaker John A. Boehner had withdrawn from negotiations to raise the $14 trillion federal debt limit and save the government from a catastrophic default. Nobody wanted to be there Boehner later recalled. The presidents still pissed.They had about 10 days left before the government would run out of money. Given the global importance of U.S. Treasury securities failing to extend the debt limit could trigger a worldwide economic meltdown.Boehner said he believed that he and the others � Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi � had a plan. He told Obama: We think we can work this out. Give us a little more time. Well come back to you. We are not going to negotiate this with you.Obama objected saying that he couldnt be left out of the process. Ive got to sign this bill.Reid the most powerful Democrat on Capitol Hill spoke up. The congressional leaders want to speak privately he said. Give us some time.This was it. Congress was taking over. The leaders were asking the president to leave the meeting he had called.Before the meeting without telling Obama the four leaders had tentatively agreed on the framework of a deal. The congressional plan guaranteed that the debt limit would have to be revisited during the 2012 presidential campaign and Obama was insisting that any agreement would have to take the country through the election.Around 10 p.m. Obama called Boehner who was at dinner with friends. I am not going to sign a bill that requires me to deal with the debt ceiling a second time before the election the president told him. He was furious.Listen Boehner said he told Obama. I understand it....But youre not going to have a choice. Weve got an agreement.Obama again said he would veto such a bill.Were too close to default to reopen the talks Boehner said. Congress is going to move forward on its own.The president told his senior staff that the call with Boehner had led nowhere. So weve got to figure out Plan B. Which is how do we get out of this thing? he said.The problem was that they did not have a Plan B.IT WAS INCREASINGLY clear that no one was running Washington. That was trouble for everyone but especially for Obama. Although running things is a joint venture between the president and Congress a president has to dominate Congress � or at least be seen as dominating Congress. The last president to fold was George H.W. Bush who gave in to Democrats demands that income taxes be raised in a 1990 budget deal. And Bush had been a one-term president.Obama sent word that he wanted the two Democratic leaders at the White House at 6 p.m. that Sunday July 24. No reason was given.Reid arrived in the Oval Office with his chief of staff David Krone.Harry the president began I hear you have kind of an outline a framework of something.Reid began to lay out the two-step $2.7 trillion debt limit extension then stopped. He was not a details guy. Well let David just tell you what it is he said.It was highly unusual for someone to pass the ball so completely to a staffer. The 44-year-old Krone outlined the plan including a secret Republican pledge to count $1 trillion in savings from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan toward deficit reduction. That was surprising. Earlier Boehner had not been willing to accept this accounting gimmick.I dont trust these guys the president said dismissively. Krone either would not or could not conceal his anger. Wait a second Obama said interrupting someone else who was about to speak. I can tell David has something else to say.Mr. President I am sorry � with all due respect � that we are in this situation that were in but we got handed this football on Friday night. And I didnt create this situation. The first thing that baffles me is from my private-sector experience the first rule that Ive always been taught is to have a Plan B. And it is really disheartening that you that this White House did not have a Plan B.Several jaws dropped as the Hill staffer blasted the president to his face.So I dont have a lot of options in the past 36 48 hours to put together Krone continued. Were supposed to be the ones that fend off an economic catastrophe. And what we find ourselves is now with no deal were going to have to root for the worst possible things to happen in order to prove to the Republicans that you cannot be so callous and let the debt limit expire.That is a horrible position that were in Krone said. And so this may not be the perfect deal but its the only deal that we have on the table right now in the situation that we find ourselves.Obama replied: I understand what you think youre doing. Im not doing that. The one thing that we need to bring stability to this economy is not throwing the debt limit increase back into the political arena. Im not doing that under any circumstances. So if that means that Im not signing this bill Im not signing the bill.After the meeting Obama made a beeline for Krone. The others stepped back so the two could talk but they still overheard the presidents words.Im sorry Obama said putting an arm around Krones shoulder. You didnt deserve that. I know how hard youre working and I know we wouldnt even have a chance without you.Reid gave Krone a ride back to the Capitol. The majority leader was almost like a father to him. You stood up to him Reid said. He needed to hear it and nobody was telling him.Asked later about the meeting with Reid and Krone Obama said What I said to them is essentially any short-term deal is not going to be acceptable. We can go back to the drawing board but were running out of time. They need to understand were not going to do a short-term deal.After more pressure from Obama Reid split from the other congressional leaders. Later that night he released a $2.7 trillion deficit reduction plan with a single-step debt limit increase that would last through 2012.Five days later on Friday July 29 by a narrow margin of 218 to 210 the House passed Boehners version of the proposal. It included the two-step procedure that the president adamantly opposed.IN THE WHITE House at 10 later that night Obamas key advisers discussed the House vote in the office of William Daley the White House chief of staff. There was a chance the Senate Democrats would fold because the fastest solution would be to pass the House bill and get out of town for their summer recess. If the bill managed to gain Senate approval would the president really veto it?You cant veto Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told the group. You cannot be responsible for default. Anything had to be done to prevent it. Anything to preserve the global economy.If he caves said David Plouffe Obamas senior political adviser it will have long-lasting political repercussions that we may never get out of. If we draw a line in the sand on something this important and cross it we may never be able to come back.Geithner had to deal with the possibility that the House bill could reach Obamas desk. My recommendation to the president would be weve got to sign this. If thats what they offer us we sign it.Obama appeared unexpectedly at the door. Whats going on? What are you guys talking about?He knew of course. They quickly recapped.Could I actually veto it? Obama asked adopting his law professor manner. What would happen on the day of the veto? The day after?It would have massive effects Geithner said. Treasury had to conduct a bond auction in the open market in about five days the regular Tuesday auction with settlement on Thursday. That first auction could be a kind of tripwire setting off a chain reaction. The federal government couldnt pay its bills. Why would anyone buy U.S. bonds if its an open question whether we are going to have the authority to pay for them?Another possible outcome Geithner said was perhaps worse. Suppose we have an auction and no one shows up?The cascading impact would be unknowable. The world could decide to dump U.S. Treasuries. Prices would plummet interest rates would skyrocket. The one pillar of stability the United States the rock in the global economy could collapse.So the president said if we give $1.2 trillion now in spending cuts � the amount in the House bill to get the first increase in the debt ceiling for about six to nine months � what happens next time? The Republicans would then come back next year in the middle of the presidential campaign and impose more conditions on the next debt ceiling increase. He could not give the Republicans that kind of weapon. It was hostage taking. It was blackmail.So Obama said they had to break the Republicans on this. Otherwise they would be back whenever it suited them politically.They were out of options Geithner said. The only one might be accepting the House bill loathsome as it might be. The 2008 financial crisis will be seen as a minor blip if we default he said.The president said The Republicans are forcing the risk of a default on us. I cant stop them from doing that. We can have the fight now or we can have the fight later on but the fight is coming to us.So no Obama said he was not going to cave. Period. He said good night got up and left. He was very agitated.Geithner thought there was one other consideration. He did not mention it to anyone not even the president but he had thought about it a great deal. It was not just that Obama faced an economic choice or a political choice. He faced a moral choice.The president should not put himself in the position of saying unequivocally that he would veto Geithner concluded for one simple reason: No one could be sure how to put the American or the global economy back together again. The impact would be calamitous.Obama n ever had to confront the veto question. A few days later House Republicans dropped their insistence on the two-step plan. The final plan accepted a debt limit increase that would take the country through the 2012 presidential contest. It also postponed $2.4 trillion in spending cuts until early 2013.The long-term deficit crisis had not been solved but merely put off leaving the United States at the edge of the fiscal cliff where it remains today.From The Price of Politics by Bob Woodward. �2012 by Bob Woodward.

JERUSALEM (AP) � Officials say the Israeli prime minister is holding a series of meetings with his coalition partners to determine whether he needs to call early parliamentary elections.If Benjamin Netanyahu is unable to convince members of his coalition to back his budget for the coming year he will be forced to bring elections currently slated for next October to early next year.The Israeli officials say Netanyahu is expected to make a decision within two weeks. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing coalition deliberations.Israeli governments rarely serve their full terms. Netanyahus Likud Party has said its unclear whether the budget which is expected to include deep cuts would be passed.	2	2	3	3	2	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	1	2	2
CHICAGO (AP) � Teenage girls may prefer the pill the patch or even wishful thinking but their doctors should be recommending IUDs or hormonal implants � long-lasting and more effective birth control that you dont have to remember to use every time the nations leading gynecologists group said Thursday.The IUD and implants are safe and nearly 100 percent effective at preventing pregnancy and should be first-line recommendations the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in updating its guidance for teens.Both types of contraception are more invasive than the pill requiring a doctor to put them in place. That and cost are probably why the pill is still the most popular form of contraception in the U.S.But birth control pills often must be taken at the very same time every day to be most potent. And forgetting to take even one can lead to pregnancy which is why the pill is sometimes only 91 percent effective.An IUD or intrauterine device is a small T-shaped piece of plastic inserted in the uterus that can prevent pregnancy for up to 10 years. An implant is a matchstick-size plastic rod that releases hormones. It is placed under the skin of the upper arm and usually lasts three years.The new guidelines dont tell teens not to use other methods but if your goal is to prevent a pregnancy then using an implant or an IUD would be the best way to do this said Dr. Tina Raine-Bennett head of the committee that wrote the recommendations.The organizations previous guidelines issued in 2007 also encouraged the use of IUDs and implants among teenagers. The new guidelines go further in saying physicians should discuss the two types of birth control with sexually active teens at every doctor visit.The gynecologists group said condoms should still be used at all times because no other birth control method protects against AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.While it may sound surprising that such invasive contraceptives are being endorsed for teenagers 43 percent of girls ages 15 to 19 have had sex a government survey found. Most are using some kind of effective birth control but only about 5 percent use the long-lasting devices the gynecologists group said.In 21 states all teenagers can get contraceptives without parental permission according to the Guttmacher Institute which tracks laws affecting womens health. A few other states allow it under certain circumstances.The IUD and implant cost hundreds of dollars. The new health reform law requires health insurance plans to cover birth control without co-payments. Also some publicly funded health clinics offer birth control free or at a reduced cost.The American Academy of Pediatrics has been more cautious and has not endorsed specific methods of birth control but is updating its guidance. Some pediatricians have been reluctant to recommend IUDs for teens partly because of concerns over infection risks an older model was blamed for infertility.Dr. Paula Braverman a University of Cincinnati physician involved in updating the academys position said the gynecologists advice does a good job of clarifying misconceptions about IUDs and implants.An IUD called the Dalkon Shield that was sold in the 1970s was linked to dangerous and sometimes deadly infections. Newer IUDs have been found to be safe and the gynecologists group said the risk of pelvic infections increases only slightly during the first three weeks after insertion.The hormonal implant has been updated too. The newest kind uses just one thin rod an older type no longer sold in the U.S. used six rods that sometimes didnt stay in place. IUDs and implants can be removed at any time with no lasting effect on fertility the gynecologists group said.The ones on the market today are extremely safe said Dr. Mary Fournier an adolescent-medicine specialist at Chicagos Ann & Robert H. Lurie Childrens Hospital who praised the new recommendations. That is what everybody should be telling their patients.She said she already recommends IUDs for her patients and is being trained in how to insert birth control implants.Raine-Bennett research director for womens health at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland Calif. said she gets mixed reactions from her patients about both methods.Some of them say Great! Something that I dont have to think about. Others are like Hmmm something in my body? It really varies she said.Doctors need to be sensitive to that and provide detailed information to dispel any myths and allow teens to make informed decisions Raine-Bennett said.___Online:ACOG: http://www.acog.orgCDC birth control information: http://tinyurl.com/nhrf9p___AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/LindseyTanner	3	4	4	2	4	3	3	3	2	2	3	2	2	2	3
ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast will abolish a 20-year-old tax break given to local cocoa grinders when the 2012/13 season starts on October 1 an official with the top growers marketing board told Reuters on Saturday in a victory for exporters who dont grind locally.The move was announced at a board meeting of the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC) late on Friday during which the body also decided to increase a key transportation-reimbursement allowance at the heart of a row threatening reform of the sector.Exporters Cargill Barry Callebaut CEMOI and ADM who process a portion of their cocoa domestically all benefit from a reduced DUS (droit unique de sortie) tax - the main cocoa export tax - and stand to lose if the tax break is scrapped.Rival exporters say the subsidy gives the grinders an unfair advantage and cost Ivory Coast 34 billion CFA francs in 2010. Farmers argue that this lost tax money should have been reinvested in the sector.The president of the (CCC) informed the board of directors of the governments decision to totally repeal the fiscal advantage given to cocoa grinders a board member told Reuters asking not to be named.This decision takes effect starting with the next harvest and should allow everyone to work together on equal footing he said.The government introduced tax incentives for local grinders during the 1991/1992 cocoa season to encourage investment in the country create jobs in the cocoa sector and increase grinding capacity.Initially meant to last five years and apply only to exports during the April to September mid-crop the incentives are now granted year-round and are currently worth about 75 CFA francs per kilogram of cocoa.In 2010 Ivory Coast became the worlds top cocoa grinder with a capacity of 532000 tonnes turned mainly into cocoa butter and powder.As part of a sweeping reform of the cocoa sector the government is aiming to locally grind half of its cocoa bean production by 2015. Currently around 35 percent of beans are processed locally.Cocoa grinders have however said the incentives do not give them any special advantage and that removing them could hurt the local grinding industry and even push some to move plants to neighbouring Ghana the worlds second-biggest producer after Ivory Coast.TRANSPORT COSTSThe new cocoa season opens next month under a government-led scheme that uses the proceeds from forward-selling of the crop to guarantee prices for farmers and encourage them to reinvest in their plantations.The Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC) is due within days to set a farmgate price as well as a scale of cost reimbursement for exporters including handling costs incurred to get the beans from farm to port.But exporter and merchant groups have said that if the anticipated transportation and collection cost allowances are not increased they will ignore the governments farmgate price.The CCC has now informally suggested an increased allowance of 70 CFA francs per kg but exporters have demanded an increase to 94.2 francs.The transport and collection cost...was raised from 70 francs to 80 francs the CCC official said.The board of directors decided on this increase to avoid a blockage in October...This is the maximum we can do for them.	4	4	3	3	4	3	2	3	3	2	3	1	1	1	3
FLORHAM PARK N.J. (AP) � Darrelle Revis is back in action for the New York Jets.The All-Pro cornerback was cleared Thursday for contact in practice for the first time since suffering a concussion in the teams season opener. And as far as Revis is concerned theres no doubt whether hell be on the field against the Dolphins in Miami.Im playing Revis said after practice. The doctors cleared me so Ill be playing Sunday.He has no more restrictions and just to show how ready he is Revis jokingly added: I can bang my head on a wall if I want to.Coach Rex Ryan was also optimistic about Revis chances of playing Sunday but said before practice that hell lean on the teams doctors before saying the cornerback will definitely be on the field in Miami.If its not the final hurdle I dont want to be saying something that isnt true Ryan said. Hopefully hell play but I guess well see.Revis practiced fully Thursday after passing all required tests. He needed to be cleared by the team physician and an independent neurologist to participate in contact drills. Revis was injured Sept. 9 against Buffalo when he was accidentally kicked in the head by teammate Bart Scott while attempting a tackle.The cornerback said he didnt need to be re-evaluated after practice anymore since he was cleared medically so barring a setback Revis will be back in the Jets secondary on Sunday.I think you feel good when you have the best player on the field Ryan said. That cant hurt you. ... Theres only one Darrelle Revis. I know I feel great about it. Its hard not to smile if hes out there. You feel great as a playcaller.And it comes at a good time for the Jets (1-1) who take on the AFC East-rival Dolphins (1-1) in a game with some early importance.This is a must-win for us Revis said. We need this win. The expectations are high for us to go down there and get a win Sunday.Revis didnt travel with the Steelers for the game in Pittsburgh after not being cleared for contact late last week. He said he felt as though he were in a fog right after he was injured but progressively felt better.Today it felt good Revis said. I actually got a couple jams in on press (coverage) and got physical with some guys. Contact actually felt good today hitting guys and guys were hitting me back.Revis added that he felt pretty good Wednesday too and told the trainers that he didnt want to wear the red non-contact jersey in practice.His presence will be a big boost to the Jets defense which received solid play from Kyle Wilson in his place but Revis is considered by many to be the best player in the league at his position.Im definitely happy that hes cleared for contact Ryan said. Without question Im happy about that for his sake. He loves to play but if hes healthy I think thats the big thing. As a coach having probably if hes not the premier defensive player in the league hes certainly up there so having him as a player obviously youre happy for that also.Without Revis on the field the Jets allowed Ben Roethlisberger to throw for 275 yards and two touchdowns. He also had a passer rating of 125.1.Im just one guy Revis said. Im just happy to be back.The challenge this week for the Jets will be defending do-it-all running back Reggie Bush but having Revis in the lineup will help them try to shut down the Dolphins receivers and force rookie Ryan Tannehill into making mistakes.Having a special player like Darrelle we ask him to do a lot of different things Ryan said. A lot of times we put him one-on-one with a guy on a teams best receiver and roll coverage away from him. Hes just that kind of guy.Tight end Dustin Keller (right hamstring) and safety Eric Smith (hip/knee) were upgraded Thursday to limited after not practicing Wednesday.Getting Keller back would also be a big help to the offense which struggled last week without the tight end on the field. Keller injured his right hamstring in the Jets second preseason game against Carolina and then tweaked it again during practice last Wednesday.Well see how he goes through practice today but its much better than yesterday when he was out Ryan said. Hopefully that is a sign that hell play this week.Fullback John Conner (right knee) linebacker Bryan Thomas (hamstring) defensive back Ellis Lankster (lower back) and safety LaRon Landry (heel) didnt practice � although Landrys absence was expected. The team gives him one day off from practice each week to reduce wear and tear on his heel which caused him to miss the end of last season with the Washington Redskins.___NOTES: Landry was called for a personal foul for a late hit last week and another for a horse-collar tackle but Ryan enjoys the safetys aggressive style. I love the fact he has a reputation as a huge hitter because hes clean the coach said. There isnt anybody saying hes not a clean player. Hes a clean player. Hes a hitter. Landry wont slow down or change the way he plays either. When Im in the game Im not thinking about a penalty Im about to have or anything like that he said. Im just playing a play to win and do anything to help my team out. ... ST coordinator Mike Westhoff has said this will be his 30th and final year coaching in the NFL and he hasnt reconsidered at any point so far. I dont close doors but I think I just made a decision that this would be enough and the time to maybe look at something else Westhoff said.	2	3	3	2	3	4	3	2	3	3	4	4	3	2	3
SAN JOSE Calif. (AP) � A federal judge has lifted a ban on sales of Samsung Electronics Corp.s Galaxy 10.1 tablet computer.U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh ruled Monday the South Korean technology giant is now free to start selling the product in American stores.The judge had previously banned U.S. sales of the tablet pending the resolution of a sweeping patent trial between Apple Inc. and Samsung over vital technology used in smartphones and tablet computers.A jury in September ordered Samsung to pay Apple $1 billion after finding many of Samsungs products illegally used technology developed by Apple for its iPhones and iPads. But the jury found that Samsungs Galaxy 10.1 wasnt one of the offending products.The judge scheduled a December hearing to consider Samsungs demand for a new trial.	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	3	4	2	3	1	2	2	3
NEW YORK (AP) � Viewers of Katie Courics talk show were doubtless surprised on Monday when during the discussion of eating disorders Couric disclosed that she had had her own struggles with that cruel sometimes deadly condition.I wrestled with bulimia all through college and for two years after that she said describing the guilt she felt at eating a single cookie or chewing a stick of gum that wasnt sugar-free.But the bulk of the show was devoted to her guests who included experts on the subject as well as its sufferers notably singer and new X Factor judge Demi Lovato.During the hour Couric said little more about her experience which she had never before made public.I kind of hesitated to even bring it up she told The Associated Press after the taping. But I felt that if I expect people on my show to be honest then when relevant I owe it to people watching to be honest myself.I wanted to focus on my guests she said while acknowledging one of the reasons this issue is so important to me: I went through it.Its all part of a balance Couric is striving for on her new syndicated daytime show Katie between sharing her experiences and turning her show into a personal confessional.But in an exclusive interview with the AP Couric 55 shared details about the illness that first plagued her as a senior at Yorktown High School in Arlington Va.It began she said when she learned she had been turned down by the college she most wanted to attend.Couric was a likely candidate for an eating disorder.Like a lot of young women I was struggling with my body image she said and feeling like I wasnt good enough or attractive enough or thin enough.She termed her figure at the time as curvy and not the cultural ideal which she identified as five-foot-eight and weighing 115 pounds. It can be so difficult to embrace the body that you have if it doesnt fit with the ideal. Women get praised for being super-thin so you keep striving to be that way.She said her disorder ebbed and flowed through the years.Some periods were worse than others when I was binging and purging a lot she said. Id have a piece of gum that wasnt sugarless and then say Oh! Ive been bad and then feel so terrible that I would eat and throw up. It was awful.But what Im describing is something so many people have gone through or are going through she noted and its so damaging both psychically and physically.Couric attended the University of Virginia then landed her first job at the ABC News bureau in Washington D.C. And even then she was waging a battle with food.With the help of a therapist she had a grip on her condition by her early 20s though it didnt mean that I didnt still have issues and feel bad about myself.But since then she said Ive learned how to have a much healthier relationship with food and how to enjoy my life without obsessing about food.She said she was glad she had shared with viewers her ordeal with bulimia because its so commonplace.And its not the first time Couric has let the public in on a personal ordeal. Her audience shared her pain from the death of her husband Jay Monahan of colon cancer in 1998. The tragedy led Couric then a co-anchor of Today to become an advocate for colon cancer awareness and for colonoscopies. In 2000 she underwent a colonoscopy on the air.The educational aspect far outweighed any personal embarrassment I might have felt she explained. I had just lost my husband at 42 to this No. 2 cancer killer of men and women. I had a bully pulpit from which I could implore people to take steps that could potentially save their lives. It was a no-brainer.In the future viewers of Katie can expect her to confide in them again when it feels right.I dont think there are any huge revelations about myself that need to be shared or would be appropriate to share she said. But Im trying to strike the right balance of talking about my situation but not focusing on it so much that Im being put on the couch.___Online:http://www.katiecouric.com___EDITORS NOTE � Frazier Moore is a national television columnist for The Associated Press.

It�s no secret that there�s an obesity epidemic in America. But the side effects from being overweight including cancer risks continue to multiple.Early treatment of prostate cancer one of the most common cancers in men is usually very successful. But ScienceDaily reports today that �obesity increases the risk of aggressive prostate disease. New research published in BioMed Centrals open access journal BMC Medicine finds that the fat surrounding the prostate of overweight or obese men with prostate cancer provides a favorable environment to promote cancer growth.�While they note that fat �is a major player in the immune system which protects the body from infection and disease� the bad news is that �too much fat can cause these systems to go haywire and can increase the risk of diabetes cardiovascular disease and cancer.�MORE: Facebook-ing Away the Pounds: Social Media Promotes Weight LossAnd this new research shows that �Regardless of type of prostate disease the overweight men had different levels of gene activity in the fat surrounding their prostates compared to the lean men.�To put things in perspective the National Cancer Institute (NCI) says that in �One study using NCI Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data estimated that in 2007 in the United States about 34000 new cases of cancer in men (4 percent) and 50500 in women (7 percent) were due to obesity. The percentage of cases attributed to obesity varied widely for different cancer types but was as high as 40 percent for some cancers particularly endometrial cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma.�Earlier this year the journal Science observed that �Insulin and a related hormone known as insulin-like growth factor (IGF) are now at the center of a growing wave of research around the world aimed at elucidating what many scientists consider to be their critical role in fueling a wide range of cancers. Elevated levels of insulin and IGF are also the leading candidates to explain a significant correlation in epidemiology that has gained attention over the past 30 years: Obese and diabetic individuals have a far higher risk than lean healthy people of getting cancer and when they do get it their risk of dying from it is greater.�Furthermore in March USA Today reported �Although the overall rate of new cancer cases is declining . . . excess weight and a sedentary lifestyle are risk factors for one-quarter to one-third of common cancers in the USA. About one-third of adults�almost 78 million�are obese roughly 30 or more pounds over a healthy weight.They go on to quote physician Marcus Plescia director of the division of cancer prevention for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who said I dont think Americans understand the association between cancer and obesity . . . We do know people are afraid of cancer. They know about the links (from obesity) to diabetes heart disease and arthritis but many dont know about this. They need to know.Consider yourself warned.Are these findings likely to make you more aware of the dangers of being overweight and cause changes in your behavior if you find you�re putting on the pounds?Lawrence Karol is a writer and editor who lives with his dog Mike.

BENGHAZI Libya (AP) � Hundreds of protesters stormed the compound of one of Libyas strongest armed Islamic extremist groups Friday evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building as the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador and four other Americans sparked a public backlash against armed groups that run rampant in the country and defy the countrys new post-Moammar Gadhafi leadership.Armed men at the administrative center for the Ansar al-Shariah militia suspected to have led the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Benghazi consulate first fired in the air to disperse the crowd but eventually withdrew from the site with their weapons and vehicles after it was surrounded by waves of protesters shouting No to militias.I dont want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders I only want to see people in uniform said Omar Mohammed a university student who took part in the takeover which protesters said was done in support of the army and police.No deaths were reported in the incident which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi in a rally against armed militias. A vehicle was also burned at the compound which was taken over by Libyan security forces after its occupants fled.For many Libyans last weeks attack on the U.S. Consulate in the eastern city of Benghazi was the last straw with one of the biggest problems Libya has faced since Gadhafis ouster and death around a year ago � the multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the regular armed forces and police.The militias a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Gadhafis regime tout themselves as protectors of Libyas revolution providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs detaining and intimidating rivals and carrying out killings. Militias made up of Islamic radicals are notorious for attacks on Muslims who dont abide by their hardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar al-Shariah led the attack on the U.S. consulate.Some 30000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on Friday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar al-Shariah.No no to militias the crowd chanted filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. Benghazi is in a trap signs read. Where is the army where is the police?Other signs mourned the killing of U.S. Amb. Chris Stevens reading The ambassador was Libyas friend and Libya lost a friend. Military helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead and police mingled in the crowd buoyed by the support of the protesters.Several thousand Ansar al-Shariah supporters lined up in front of their headquarters in the face of the crowd waving black and white banners. There were some small scuffles but mostly the two sides mingled and held discussions in the square.The march was the biggest seen in Benghazi Libyas second largest city and home to 1 million people since the fall of Gadhafi in August 2011. The unprecedented public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government which has been unable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled the growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces.Residents of another main eastern city Darna have also begun to stand up against Ansar al-Shariah and other militias.The anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of Benghazi has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists. During the Gadhafi era it was the hotbed of a deadly Islamist insurgency against his regime. A significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna. During the revolt against him last year Gadhafis regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and ally itself with al-Qaida.But now the residents are lashing out against Ansar al-Shariah the main Islamic extremist group in the city.The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation. It was disastrous said Ayoub al-Shedwi a young bearded Muslim preacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio show he hosts. We felt that the revolution is going in vain.Al-Shedwi said some were afraid that if they dont act to rein them in the U.S. will strike against the militias pushing people to support the gunmen.Leaders of tribes which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya have come forward to demand that the militias disband. Tribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no longer have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests. That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are killed.Activists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darnas Sahaba Mosque calling on tribes to put an end to the state of terrorism created by the militias. At the citys main hotel The Jewel of Darna tribal figures activists local officials and lawmakers have been meeting in recent days to come up with a plan.Until when the tribes will remain silent cried a bearded young man standing on a podium at one such meeting Thursday. The militias dont recognize the state. The state is pampering them but this is not working anymore. You must act right now. Elders in traditional Libyan white robes stood up and shouted in support.Militiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna. On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi a number of elderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services were attacked reportedly beaten or stabbed. There have been 32 killings over the past few months including the city security chief and assassinations of former officers from Gadhafis military.Darnas residents are conservative but they largely dont fit the citys reputation as extremists. Women wear headscarves but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face. In the ancient citys narrow alleys shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare Western songs.And many are impatient with Ansar al-Shariahs talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law. The groups name means Supporters of Shariah Law.We are not infidels for God sake. We have no bars no discos we are not practicing vice in the street said Wassam ben Madin a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising against Gadhafi. This is not the time for talk about Shariah. Have a state first then talk to me about Shariah.If they are the supporters of Shariah then who are we? he said. We dont want the flag of al-Qaida raised over heads he added referring to Ansar al-Shariahs black banner.One elder resident at the Sahaba Mosque sit-in Ramadan Youssef said We will talk to them peacefully. We will tell them you are from us and you fought for us during the civil war against Gadahfi. But if you say no (to integrating into the) police and army we will storm your place. Its over.Officials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias. The armed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police.So the government has created a High Security Committee aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to integration. Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1000 dinars around $900 to join � compared to the average police monthly salary of around $200. However the militias that join still do not abide by government authority and critics say the lure of salaries has only prompted more militias to form.Officials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil war against Gadhafi at around 30000. But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several hundred thousand.All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming said Khaled Hadar a Benghazi-based lawyer. The government is only making temporarily solutions but you are creating a disaster.	3	3	3	4	3	3	4	4	4	2	3	3	1	4	3
ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Light rainfall and abundant sunshine across most of Ivory Coasts main cocoa regions last week will encourage healthy output as the new harvesting season opens farmers and analysts said on Tuesday.The main crop harvest in the worlds top cocoa producer opens on October 1.While improved weather in recent weeks is helping to ease worries that outbreaks of fungal disease caused by poor conditions in July and August could affect production fears that a sweeping reform of the sector may disrupt supply persist.Farmers said that most regions were primed for a healthy start to the season but continued rains and sunshine would be needed until November to ensure robust output through January.In the western region of Soubre in the heart of the Ivorian cocoa belt one analyst reported 9 millimetres of rainfall compared with 18mm the previous week.Were set to have lots of good quality cocoa for the first two months of the main crop said Lazare Ake who farms on the outskirts of Soubre.If we have good rains and lots of sunshine in October and until early November well have an abundant harvest until January he said.Similar growing conditions were reported in the western regions of Duekoue Gagnoa and Meagui and in the southern regions of Divo and Agboville.In the western region of Daloa responsible for a quarter of Ivory Coasts national output farmers reported two good showers during the week.The flowers are still coming out. Its a good sign and that is encouraging going forward. Harvesting has started on most of the plantations and there are lots of ripe and nearly ripe pods on the trees said local farmer Laurent Kouakou.In the southeastern region of Aboisso farmers reported two light showers and abundant sunshine after two weeks without rain.More and more beans are being dried in the villages in the region. The harvest will be good because there is now less black pod (disease) said Aboisso farmer Etienne Yao.In the eastern region of Abengourou one analyst reported 42mm of rains which followed a week without showers.Looking at the trees we dont think there will be a lot of cocoa in October but there will be lots of beans in November and December said farmer Marcellin NDa.A sweeping reform of the top world growers cocoa sector is meant to provide its farmers with a minimum price for their produce and is a key condition for debt relief under the IMF-World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) scheme - a vital part of its bid to rebuild after last years post-election conflict.	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	1	3

NASHVILLE Tenn. (AP) � The story of Loretta Lynns first experience with the Grand Ole Opry five decades ago sounds a little like the storyline from one of her classic songs.Lynn celebrated her 50th anniversary with country musics keystone showcase on Tuesday night in front of a standing room-only crowd at the Opry House. An emotional Miranda Lambert and her Pistol Annies Lynns sister Crystal Gayle Lee Ann Womack and Trace Adkins were among the stars to perform for Lynn who sat in the front row wearing a gold-sequined gown and a bashful smile.Lynn shared her first memories of the Opry with reporters at a news conference before the show.Well me and my husband got into town the night before and we spent the night in the car out in front of the Grand Ole Opry at Ryman Auditorium Lynn said during a news conference before the celebration of her 50th anniversary on the Opry. And we slept and the next morning of course we didnt have any money so the next morning we divided a doughnut.The salutes to Lynn were heartfelt. Lambert recounted her first conversation with Lynn in the 80-year-old Country Music Hall of Fame members kitchen and fought back tears during the news conference. Womack remembered that pile of cassette tapes that kept a lonely Texas teen company.Angaleena Presley of Pistol Annies said she lost it the second that the trio stepped out on stage during soundcheck forcing two trips to the makeup chair.For me its like I could die tomorrow and Ive already been in heaven tonight Presley said. Im from where Lorettas from (in Kentucky) and Im a coal miners daughter and I grew up doing dishes to her records with my mom and have loved her since I was a little girl. I remember coming to the Opry when I was 17 and I saw her and I was standing in the front row just hoping and dreaming Id be there some day. And tonight shes going to be in the front row listening to me sing one of her songs. Im just so tickled to be here. I mean this is just it for me.It was the first appearance on the Opry for the Annies and Lynn said its a night that will resonate for them forever � just like it has with her.The Grand Ole Opry is different and I think any Grand Ole Opry member will say that Lynn said. When you go on the Opry its just absolutely a different feeling and its something that youll never feel again.___Online:http://opry.com___For the latest country music news from the Associated Press: http://twitter.com/AP_Country.

HARRISBURG Pa. (AP) � A former Penn State graduate assistant who complained he saw former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky showering with a young boy on campus in 2001 and testified at his sex abuse trial this summer sued the university on Tuesday for what he says is defamation and misrepresentation.Mike McQuearys whistle-blower lawsuit claims his treatment by the university since Sandusky was arrested on child molestation charges in November has caused him distress anxiety humiliation and embarrassment. It seeks millions of dollars in damages.Penn State spokesman Dave La Torre declined to comment on Tuesday and McQuearys lawyer Elliot Strokoff did not return a phone message.The lawsuit discloses that shortly after Sandusky was charged the universitys then-president Graham Spanier met with athletic department staff inside the football stadium and expressed his support for athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz who had been charged with perjury and failure to properly report suspected child abuse in the Sandusky case. Spanier also issued a public statement with the same message.Curley now on leave and Schultz who has retired have repeatedly denied the charges against them and await trial.McQueary whose contract with Penn State wasnt renewed testified that he came upon Sandusky and the boy in a team shower in a sexually suggestive position on a Friday night in early 2001.He told jurors at Sanduskys trial he heard a skin-on-skin smacking sound and what he saw was more than my brain could handle. He said the boys hands were against a wall and Sandusky was behind him with his midsection moving subtly.McQueary reported the episode to then-head football coach Joe Paterno who in turn alerted Curley and Schultz. Paterno was fired after the three men were charged and he died of complications from lung cancer in January.McQueary claims that the November meeting with Spanier clearly suggest(ed) that (McQueary) was lying in his reports and testimonies that he had reported the sexual misconduct.Spaniers statements have irreparably harmed (McQuearys) reputation for honesty and integrity and have irreparably harmed (his) ability to earn a living especially in his chosen profession of coaching football the lawsuit said.Messages left for Spanier and his lawyer on Tuesday were not immediately returned.The lawsuit said McQueary learned his contract was not being renewed meaning he was no longer a university employee from a news conference held in July by the universitys new president Rodney Erickson. He said his salary last year was $140000 and his future earnings as a coach would amount to at least $4 million.Sandusky a former defensive coordinator was convicted in June on charges he sexually abused 10 boys some on campus. He remains jailed awaiting sentencing.Eight young men testified against Sandusky describing a range of abuse they said went from grooming and manipulation to fondling oral sex and anal rape when they were boys. One young man testified his muffled screams from the basement of the Sandusky home in State College where Penn State is based went unanswered as Sandusky attacked him.The 68-year-old Sandusky maintains his innocence acknowledging he showered with boys but insisting he never molested them. Given his age and the serious nature of the crimes of which he was convicted hes likely to receive a sentence that will keep him in prison for life.___Online:Complaint: http://bit.ly/QGGAwt	4	4	3	3	4	3	4	3	2	2	3	2	1	3	4
MEXICO CITY (AP) � Mexican prosecutors say they will continue investigating the botched-gun smuggling probe known as Operation Fast and Furious even after a U.S. Justice Department internal watchdog report concluded that more than a dozen officials should be disciplined.In a Friday statement the Mexican Attorney Generals Office says its looking at the document released this week to see what it could add to its own probe.U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has been accused of knowing about the bungled operation but the report cleared him and faulted mid-level and senior officials for not briefing him.Fast and Furious allowed low-level straw buyers in gun-trafficking networks to leave with loads to track the guns to major traffickers. But some guns wound up at crime scenes in Mexico and the U.S.	3	4	3	2	2	2	2	3	2	2	2	2	1	2	2

NEW YORK (AP) � Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi the countrys first democratically elected leader says freedom of expression must be joined with responsibility in a speech that addressed the violent clashes that erupted across the Muslim world in reaction to an anti-Islam video produced in the United States.Morsi a key figure in the Muslim Brotherhood was speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative in New York on Tuesday. He did not outline what limitations he believes should be imposed on free speech. The new Egyptian leader addresses the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.He condemned the violent acts of some demonstrators.

Centre College in Danville Ky. is home to this years vice presidential debate. With thousands of attendees campaign staff and reporters -- and all of their smartphones tablets laptops and other connected gear -- descending on campus Oct. 11 it takes impressive technology and a coordinated effort to keep the data running smoothly.[More from Mashable: Our iPhones Are Depleting the Earth�s Resources [INFOGRAPHIC]]To give an idea of the challenge the colleges IT crew is expecting approximately 1500-2000 wireless-connected devices at any given time with an average 2.5 wireless devices per attendee -- and that doesnt count the computers and other equipment that calls for a hardline connection. Its also the team admits an estimation.Bandwidth is a big guess said Shane Wilson coordinator of Network Services at Centre College. The only data we have is from 2008 and thats basically ancient history. We feel very confident about 2 gigabits of bandwidth.[More from Mashable: Behind the Social Media Campaigns of Obama and Romney]How is the college preparing to deliver problem-free data connections?To make sure theres enough bandwidth to go around Centre College will be temporarily expanding its Internet connection from 250 megabits to 2 gigabits. Thats an eightfold increase using two single-gigabit links running simultaneously. Mobile providers are also bringing in trucks to help boost the mobile phone and data signals in the immediate area.And what about network problems? For network engineers concerned about stability during a high-traffic event redundancy is the name of the game. Accordingly Centre Network worked with several vendors to set up a temporary network thats running separate from the campus network.The new network is fully redundant with four routers multiple backbone links and multiple core paths giving Centre Colleges IT staff the ability to quickly adapt is something goes wrong on debate day.Theres also a power redundancy -- the debate hall is run on a diesel generator but it can be quickly switched to standard line power if theres a problem (its quicker to switch from diesel to electric than vice-versa). And like a military tanker jet high above a field of combat diesel gas trucks will be waiting nearby in case they need to refuel.And what if something goes wrong on the provider side like physical damage to fiber? The colleges staff will have support cases with CISCO AT&T and Time Warner Cable open in advance drastically speeding up any necessary repairs. AT&T and Time Warner will also have trained technicians on site ready to go in case of an emergency -- think of them as network first responders.With so many connected devices security is surely a concern. Centre Colleges staff says theyll be using separate VLAN SSID networks for each of the campaigns as well for the media and other major groups involved with the debate. Each network will use encrypted 802.11x to help keep the campaigns from spying on one anothers traffic and the media from spying on the campaigns traffic.Will it all work? On Thursday afternoon Centre College invited about 120 faculty staff and students to help test the network and look for problems. A few were found and quickly fixed -- a result that built confidence among the Centre College team.We discovered problems and corrected them -- and that was the goal said Wilson. I feel much better than if everything had gone smoothly. If that happened I wouldve wondered what was left uncovered.The tech involved in running a nationally-televised debate has drastically changed in the last 12 years said Art Moore Centre Colleges director of information technology services. Moore was at the college when it hosted the 2000 vice presidential debate between Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman.The world completely has changed in the last 12 years when it was all about analog telephone lines said Moore. The media then was doing dial-up to get Internet access. We provided phone lines... and gave one data line each to the campaign workspaces. We didnt even have laptops in 2000.Images courtesy of Flickr Center for American Progress Action Fund Gage SkidmoreThis story originally published on Mashable here.	4	4	4	3	3	3	2	3	2	4	3	1	1	1	3

DENVER (AP) � The men in stripes have drawn so much attention this season that some interesting developments on the football field have gone largely unnoticed like a big spike in field goal accuracy.NFL teams combined for a record 2287 points in the first three weeks of the season thanks to a record 248 touchdowns.Kickers have done their part in this proliferation of points converting 182 field goal attempts and missing just 15 for a 92.4 percent clip � the best three-week start ever.The three-week mark tends to be a precursor for the entire season with the final accuracy rate dipping two or three percentage points as the weather gets worse and the pressure rises.That means the record set in 2008 of 84.5 percent could be obliterated this season.The league-wide field goal percentage last season was 82.9 percent second-highest all-time. Through three weeks last season the number was 85.8 percent according to STATS LLC.If this years figure drops a similar 2.9 percentage points it would end up at 89.5 percent an enormous jump statistically speaking.Denver Broncos kicker Matt Prater the most accurate kicker in league history from 50 yards and out said he thinks this years spike is the culmination of several factors ranging from better athletes to improved coaching and superior training.Guys are just getting better and better Prater said. You get guys who are veterans in there and they learn from their mistakes and dont want to repeat them.Yet its not just the icy veined veterans who are nailing their kicks.Kickers coming out of college are having immediate success too much like the better-prepared rookie quarterbacks who no longer have to bide their time as backups.Heading into this weekends slate beginning with Thursday nights Cleveland-Baltimore game the Ravens Justin Tucker St. Louis Greg Zuerlein and Minnesotas Blair Walsh were a combined 22-for-22 with each rookie having kicked at least a 55-yarder.Tucker and Walsh have game-winners already. Tuckers beat New England 31-30 last weekend as time expired and Walshs came in overtime against Jacksonville after he kicked a 55-yarder as time expired in regulation.Theres more camps for kids coming up the ranks now Prater said. You can get a good head start on it.During their high school years both Walsh and Tucker attended kicking camps in California run by Chris Sailer who kicked for UCLA in the 1990s.Kickers are also in the weight room more employ specialized training and superior techniques kick on more favorable surfaces generally are better coached and are used more effectively and efficiently on game day.They benefit from better athleticism than their predecessors come almost exclusively from soccer backgrounds are aided by an increased emphasis on special teams and rule changes and even by playing some of their games indoors.It all adds up to greater accuracy.Coaches are starting to let more opportunities happen which will increase the percentage Walsh said. I just think guys are really starting to perfect what they do and youre seeing a lot more great kickers today than you probably did in the past. Youd have a handful of great kickers and the rest would be pretty good but not elite but I think theres a ton of elite kickers in the NFL right now.The success rate has risen steadily from all distances short and long during the Super Bowl era. In 1967 for instance barely 51 percent of all field goal attempts were good. Now nine in 10 are splitting the uprights which were moved to the back of the end zone in 1974.Back then kickers were often converted linemen who happened to have strong legs. Now every kicker in the NFL played soccer as a kid and all employ the soccer-style kick that has improved place-kickers accuracy over the decades.Hall of Fame kicker Lou The Toe Groza made 54.9 percent of his field goal attempts a percentage that would get him run off the roster today not enshrined in Canton Ohio.Kickers arent just more accurate but with such parity in the league theyre more important than ever.Through Week 3 28 games were decided by one score tied with 1988 for the most such games through the first three weeks. Last weekend seven games were decided in the final minute of regulation or overtime something thats happened just once before in 1995. Five of those came down to a field goal.Among the seven game-winning field goals so far was Tuckers 27-yarder as time expired that gave the Ravens the victory over the New England Patriots last weekend in a rematch of the AFC championship game. In that title game Billy Cundiff missed a 32-yard field goal in the closing seconds. In the encore Tucker � who took the job away from Cundiff in training camp � drove his kick just inside the right upright.Bottom line is it went in Tucker said. Thats all I care about. It went in.Patriots coach Bill Belichick wasnt so sure and he was fined $50000 this week for grabbing a replacement officials arm after the game as he tried to see if the call was reviewable. It wasnt.Tucker who beat out Cundiff with a perfect preseason attributes his success to lessons he received from head coach John Harbaugh special teams coach Jerry Rosburg and kicking consultant Randy Brown.I feel like Im kicking the best I ever kicked Tucker said. Took a little work took a couple of days and now I feel like Im striking the ball as confidently as I ever have.Hes not the only one who feels that way.Praters three field goals against Houston last week moved him past Jason Elam as the most accurate kicker in team history at 81 percent and his 53-yarder made him 13 for 17 from 50 yards and out for a 76.5 percent clip the best in league history with a minimum of 10 attempts.Ryan Succops club-record sixth field goal gave Kansas City a 27-24 win in overtime at New Orleans last weekend. He was a perfect 6 for 6 on kicks ranging from 25 to 45 yards.Zuerlein a sixth-round pick out of tiny Missouri Western is 8 for 8 on field goals including a 56-yarder last week one yard shy of the Rams franchise record.What impresses his coaches is his steely resolve that belies his inexperience.I guess Im just confident in my abilities Zuerlein said. I expect to make the kick so I dont get nervous really.Rams special teams coach John Fassel said hes never worked with a kicker this talented so early in his career: You see him in the mall he looks like any other 24-year-old walking around Fassel said. But his leg speed is incredible.Zuerlein said years spent playing soccer probably account for his explosive leg power not anything he does in the weight room.I cant squat a house or anything like that Zuerlein said. Its probably about the same amount of weight just an average person might lift.So far this season theres been nothing ordinary about NFL kickers.___Online: http://pro32.ap.org/poll and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL___AP Pro Football Writer Dave Campbell and AP Sports Writers R.B.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerias naira firmed slightly against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday a day after the central bank left interest rates on hold and said it would keep monetary conditions tight dealers said.The central bank kept rates on hold for the sixth time in a row at 12 percent on Tuesday welcoming improved growth and a slight fall in headline inflation. But it said monetary measures will remain hawkish for the foreseeable future.Financial markets in Africas second biggest economy were closed when the rate decision was made on Tuesday.The naira opened for trade at 157.50 to the U.S. dollar on Wednesday higher than Tuesdays close of 157.75.Dealers said the naira was partly driven by inflows from foreign investors buying bonds at an auction on Wednesday and oil companies selling the greenback to lenders.Chevron sold around $113 million to some lenders ... NLNG sold an undisclosed amount and (there were) inflows from investors buying bonds one dealer told Reuters.Nigeria plans to sell 60 billion naira in bonds on Wednesday with maturities of five and seven years.The central bank said $1.4 billion of foreign investment flowed into debt in August.Olayemi Agbe-Davies a bond dealer at Standard Chartered Bank told Reuters debt markets had anticipated the hold decision on rates and already factored it into bond pricing so yields were largely steady on Wednesday.	3	4	3	4	3	4	4	4	2	4	2	1	2	1	3
NEW YORK (AP) � The Big Apple is getting another biggest: The worlds biggest Ferris wheel is to be built on Staten Island in an ambitious attempt to draw tourists to whats sometimes known as the citys forgotten borough officials announced ThursdayThe $230 million attraction to be called the New York Wheel is to grace a spot overlooking the Statue of Liberty New York Harbor and the downtown Manhattan skyline � a singular view that officials hope will add to the appeal what they say would be the worlds tallest Ferris wheel. The 625-foot-tall structure would swing higher than the Singapore Flyer the London Eye and a High Roller wheel planned in Las Vegas.The New York Wheel will be an attraction unlike any other in New York City � even unlike any other on the planet Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a release.Construction is expected to begin in early 2014 on the privately financed project which also includes a 100-shop outlet mall and a 200-room hotel. The grand opening could come by the end of 2015.While riding the Staten Island Ferry is a staple of many visitors agendas the city has long sought to entice tourists off the boat and into Staten Island the least populous and most remote borough � one once known for hosting the worlds largest landfill.Australian tourists Leah Field and Adam Lica for example were riding the ferry Thursday for its views of the Statue of Liberty. They thought they might have lunch on the Staten Island side but werent planning to explore further.We werent sure what there is to do there explained Lica 32 of Melbourne.Were there a giant Ferris wheel would the couple stay to ride it? Probably he said.Staten Island has its attractions including a minor league ballpark and the zoo that hosts Staten Island Chuck New Yorks answer to the famous prognosticating groundhog of Punxsutawney Pa. Chuck bears the dubious distinction of having once bitten Bloomberg.But Staten Island the only one of the citys five boroughs not accessible by subway tends to get overshadowed by its municipal neighbors so much so that some have at times suggested it secede from the city.To Staten Island resident Miatta Bryant the wheel might bring the borough more respect.I think itll be a really good idea the 26-year-old certified nursing assistant said. People always say Staten Island is so boring.The project is expected to bring $500 million in private investment to the boroughs St. George waterfront and the developers will pay the city $2.5 million a year in rent for the land.	3	4	4	4	4	3	2	3	3	2	4	2	3	2	3
KENT Ohio (Reuters) - President Barack Obama flubbed a line during a campaign speech on Wednesday mistakenly saying he wanted to export U.S. jobs before correcting himself and jokingly blaming Republican rival Mitt Romney.In the middle of remarks to an enthusiastic crowd in the battleground state of Ohio Obama was describing a five-point plan to boost employment and lay a stronger foundation for the U.S. economy when he stumbled at a crucial word.I want to see us export more jobs Obama said before catching himself quickly and saying Export more products.Excuse me he exclaimed drawing laughter. I was channeling my opponent there for a second.Obama frequently derides Romney a former private equity executive for being a pioneer of outsourcing jobs to other countries. With unemployment levels above 8 percent both men are trying to convince voters they have the better plan to create jobs and boost the economy at home.(Reporting by Lisa Lambert Writing by Jeff Mason Editing by Peter Cooney)	4	4	2	4	4	4	3	3	3	2	3	2	2	2	3

TBILISI (Reuters) - Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili promised on Wednesday to punish those responsible for torturing and raping prisoners after video of the abuse was shown on television and sparked protests in the capital Tbilisi.The government of the former Soviet republic said guards had been paid to stage the abuse for political motives less than two weeks before a parliamentary election in the former Soviet republic.The prosecutors office said 10 people had been arrested including the head of the Tbilisi prison two deputies and a number of guards. The prisons minister said she was resigning.Tonight I tell all the victims of these inhuman actions and the whole nation that the Georgia we have built and we are all building together shall not and will not tolerate such behavior - in its prisons or anywhere else Saakashvili said in a statement issued in the early hours of Wednesday.Those who committed these crimes will spend long years in jail as will those who bribed guards to stage these horrors and film them he said promising that the rights of prisoners would be better protected.Georgia a key transit route for oil and gas supplies across the volatile Caucasus region is gearing up for an October 1 election in which Saakashvili and his United National Movement face a challenge from a new opposition coalition Georgian Dream led by billionaire entrepreneur Bidzina Ivanishvili.RAPE ME POSTERSHundreds of demonstrators rallied overnight in the capital after two pro-opposition television channels including one owned by Ivanishvili showed the footage purporting to show torture rape and other abuses in the Tbilisi prison.This bloody regime should step down Dachi Tsaguria one of the organisers of the protest told Reuters.The protesters who were urged to join the rally by messages on Facebook held posters saying Rape me!Dozens of people began gathering in the center of the capital to resume the protest on Wednesday.The government said the videos had been staged and recorded by police officers who had been bribed by politically motivated persons.An investigation revealed that several members of the jails security department had been involved in a plan to carry out abusive activities and record them the Interior Ministry said in a statement.Evidence shows that payments were made to coordinate and stage these appalling activities it said.Georgian Dream which unites several opposition parties has gathered large numbers to its rallies in the Caucasus state although most opinion polls show it trails the ruling party before the election.Ivanishvili 56 has a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $6.4 billion. He and other opponents accuse Saakashvili of curbing freedoms and criticise him for leading Georgia into a disastrous war with Russia in August 2008.(Reporting by Margarita Antidze editing by Mark Trevelyan)	3	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	2	3	2	2	4	3
NEW YORK (AP) � Just after 10 p.m. when most people their age are going to sleep a group of elderly folks suffering from dementia are just getting started dancing and shaking tambourines and maracas in a raucous version of La Bamba.Its a party says an 81-year-old woman among dozens of patients brought to a Bronx nursing home every night for a structured series of singalongs crafts and therapy sessions that lasts until dawn.The program which appears to be rare is kind of a night camp for dementia victims who dont sleep at night or tend to wake up agitated or become frightened or disoriented by the fall of darkness.Its meant to provide care and activity � lots of activity � to fill the wee hours for people with Alzheimers and similar diseases who live at home. And its meant to provide their caregivers � usually a son or daughter � with a treasured nights sleep.Without this program my father would be lost and I would be crazy said Robert Garcia whose 82-year-old father Felix is in the program at the Hebrew Home at Riverdale called ElderServe at Night. He doesnt sleep. At night hes wide awake and he needs activity.Garcia who lives in a Bronx apartment with his wife and three of their children said that before his father went into the program he would wake up in the night loudly and keep everyone else from sleeping.We would all wake up and my daughter would ask Why is Grandpa screaming? Why is he so grumpy? Garcia said.Now he comes home in the morning shows me his drawings tells me what they did all night.While many nursing homes offer temporary respite care so caregivers can catch up on sleep or go on vacation the overnight-only program at the Hebrew Home fills a niche.But costs are high and such programs are rare. An official at the Alzheimers Association said she knew of no other.Daniel Reingold president and CEO of the Hebrew Home said the nonsectarian overnight program was started in 1998 because anecdotal studies found the biggest reason people gave for admitting loved ones into the nursing home was sleep deprivation of the caregiver.Someone with Alzheimers can be getting up at 3 a.m. banging the pots and pans thinking they were making dinner even walking out of the house Reingold said. We heard stories of caregivers who were sleeping on mattresses across the front doorway so their loved one couldnt get out.Most patients care is covered by Medicaid which pays the Hebrew Home $140 a night plus $74 for transportation to and from home.Dr. Robert Abrams a geriatric psychiatrist at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital said sleep problems are typical in dementia and include the syndrome known as sundowning in which the fall of darkness causes confusion and fear. At the Hebrew Home shades are kept closed.Abrams says an overnight activity program like the Hebrew Homes is preferable to fighting nature by insisting that participants try to sleep.Ruth Drew director of family services at the Alzheimers Association in Chicago said Many family members want to care for relatives with Alzheimers at home but in order to do that the caregivers themselves have to remain healthy. You cannot stay healthy if you dont get a good nights sleep.Many patients sleep a few hours at home during the day.As the night passed at the Hebrew Home other activities were offered to the 34 patients who were in their 60s to 90s. Most moved on to a cooking program where they were asked to peel and slice a banana then add grapes and blueberries for a fruit salad.During the slow process the patients were asked in English and Spanish about colors and shapes. Several downed the fruit as it came their way before salads could be compiled.Other nighttime activities include walks through the nearly empty halls of the nursing home and movie nights with popcorn. Patients who are up to it are sometimes taken on field trips for example to see the neighborhoods Christmas lights.In quiet rooms patients with more profound dementia were guided in simple puzzles like putting a peg in a hole. Others had sand or water poured over their hands to stimulate tactile sensations and perhaps reminiscences.They havent been to the beach in years said program director Deborah Messina. Maybe its a fond memory.One darkened room was filled with recorded sounds of nature a pleasant aroma and twinkly lights all meant to provide gentle stimulation.On occasion a patient would nod off. There are resting rooms for patients who want to sleep but half-hour naps in their chairs are more common.Its like a sleepover Messina said. Its a little bit of a party and like a sleepover when they come home in the morning they havent slept much.	4	4	4	2	4	3	2	4	4	2	3	2	2	1	4

CHARLOTTE N.C. (AP) � Panthers receiver Steve Smith says he lit into Cam Newton about his actions on the sidelines when the young quarterback was replaced late in the fourth quarter of Thursday nights 36-7 blowout loss to the New York Giants.Smith says he was upset when Newton remained sitting on the bench instead of watching backup Derek Anderson and trying to learn from his own mistakes.Smith says he called Newton out so he could understand this is more than about playing football its about becoming a man and understanding this is what its about.Smith says he hopes the lesson will pay off for Newton down the road.The 23-year-old Newton has taken losses hard in the past and Smith says its time for the QB to better handle adversity.	2	3	3	3	2	3	2	1	2	3	3	1	2	2	2
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes slipped in August due to a shortage of lower priced inventory in most of the country an industry group said on Thursday.The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index based on contracts signed in August fell 2.6 percent to 99.2 but was 10.7 percent higher than last year.Julys reading was revised up to 101.9 the highest level since April 2010 when buyers were racing to use the home-buyer tax credit before the deadline the group said.The performance in month-to-month contract signings has been uneven with ongoing shortages of lower priced inventory in much of the country the associations chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement.(Reporting by Rachelle Younglai Editing by Neil Stempleman)	3	2	3	3	2	3	2	3	3	2	4	2	1	2	2

The latest polls show President Obama widening his lead over Mitt Romney in Ohio and Florida crucial swing states but the Romney campaign rejects the idea that the tide is turning in favor of the Democrats. Republican skeptics say the polls are wrong because the people conducting them are interviewing too many Democrats and too few Republicans exaggerating Obamas support and underestimating Romneys. Are the major polls skewed against Romney? Here a brief guide:How much of a lead do the polls give Obama?Obama is ahead by six percentage points among registered voters and by five percentage points among those most likely to show up at the polls according to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. In Ohio a state that no Republican presidential nominee has won the presidency without Obama is ahead 53 percent to 43 percent among likely voters according to a new Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll. Real Clear Politics says that the average poll has Obama ahead with 48.7 percent to Romneys 45 percent nationwide with a five-percentage point lead in Ohio and a three-point edge in Florida. Pro-Romney skeptics say the polls � all of them � are biased in Obamas favor.SEE MORE: 4 ways Mitt Romney can defuse his 47 percent disasterWhat do they think is the problem?The skeptics say that pollsters are choosing their sample sizes based on the assumption that the 2012 turnout will be similar to 2008s when record numbers of Democratic-leaning Latino black and young voters went to the polls. This year though some of those Democrats have grown disillusioned and Republicans eager to deny Obama a second term are more motivated than they were four years ago Romney supporters say. I dont think [the polls] reflect the composition of what 2012 is going to look like Romney pollster Neil Newhouse says. Some polls even forecast a turnout even more favorable to Obama than in 2008 GOP consultant Rick Wilson says in the New York Daily News which even Obamas most dedicated partisans think is highly unlikely.Why do Republicans think the pollsters are getting it wrong?They say they smell a rat. The Democrats want to convince [anti-Obama voters] falsely that Romney will lose to discourage them from voting Republican pollsters John McLaughlin tells National Review. So they lobby the pollsters to weight their surveys to emulate the 2008 Democrat-heavy models. One conservative blogger Dean Chambers has even created a website called unskewedpolls.com where he adjusts the data according to assumptions by automated pollster Rasmussen Reports which tends to favor Republicans and concludes that Romney has led Obama 52 percent to 44 percent in the average poll since Labor Day.SEE MORE: 3 paths to electoral victory for Mitt RomneyAre the complaints valid?According to pollsters theyre ridiculous. Poll takers do weight their samples according to demographic traits such as race gender and age. Party identification though is something their polls should measure not control. The nation is roughly evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats with a smaller group of independents in between but theres usually a party-ID gap at the polls that reflects the mood of the electorate (Democrats had a seven-point edge 39 percent to 32 percent in 2008). If pollsters try to even out the numbers artificially says Doug Schwartz director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute they are substituting their own judgment as to what the electorate is going to look like. Its not scientific.So are the polls unfairly skewed against Romney or not?Look says Jim Geraghty at National Review a split of D+7 or more is excessive. A Democratic turnout advantage of three or four percentage points � halfway between the GOP peak of 2010 and the Democratic one of 2008 � is more fair. If pollsters think Dems can count on another historical high they should at least explain why. Pollsters say their critics are underestimating the weight of minorities in the electorate. The fast-growing Latino population for example favors Obama over Romney who drifted to the right on immigration during the GOP primaries. Not only that says Steve Benen at MSNBC but the notion that pollsters � literally all of them � would be deliberately publishing bogus poll results is pretty silly. Silly but predictable says Doug Mataconis at Outside the Beltway. The biased polling argument is just a sub-set of the biased media argument conservatives have flogged for decades. You can bet that if Team Romneys internal polls were better theyd be leaking them. Theyre not because polling is a science and the trend is clear. If you deny it... well Thats not skepticism thats partisan spin.SEE MORE: Mitt Romney releases his 2011 tax return: 4 takeawaysSources: The Hill MSNBC National Journal National Review (2) New York Daily News The New York Times Outside the Beltway The Wall Street JournalRead more political coverage at The Weeks 2012 Election Center.SEE MORE: Was Mitt Romney really the GOPs best candidate?View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	4	3	4	2	3	3

ST. PETERSBURG Fla. (AP) � Joe Maddon planned to sleep well regardless of whether the Tampa Bay Rays got the help they need to keep their playoff hopes alive.Ill find out tomorrow morning said Maddon who then was asked if he expected to sleep well. Absolutely. Like a baby.Bad news awaited the manager when he woke up Tuesday � his team was eliminated from postseason contention.The Rays won for the 11th time in 12 games beating Baltimore 5-3 on Monday night. That stretch kept them in contention for the ALs second wild-card until Oakland beat Texas 4-3 later Monday night.Baltimore already is assured of being in the playoffs for the first time in 15 years but still has its sights on outlasting the Yankees for the AL East title. The Orioles fell a game out of first place behind New York when the Yankees beat Boston.Weve played 12 playoff games and weve won 11 of them said Maddon whose team has outscored opponents 80-31 during the surge.  But we do need help theres no question about that. Again regardless I just love the way our guys are going about their business.Alex Cobb allowed two hits over seven innings Ben Zobrist hit his 20th homer and Chris Giminez had a two-run double off Wei-Yin Chen as the Rays pulled away from a 1-1 tie in the seventh.Cobb (11-9) yielded a fourth-inning single to J.J. Hardy and an opposite-field solo homer to Matt Wieters that had tied it in the top of the seventh.Chris Davis homered for the fifth straight game for Baltimore a two-run shot off Kyle Farnsworth that trimmed Baltimores deficit to 5-3 in the ninth.Fernando Rodney gave up singles to Adam Jones and Wieters to put the potential tying runs on base. The Rays closer struck out Jim Thome and Mark Reynolds before getting Endy Chavez to hit a grounder back to mound to end the game. It was Rodneys 47th save in 49 opportunities.We didnt take care of our business. We lost Jones said. When it comes to the Yankees we cant control them. We cant control if they win or lose.The Orioles arrived in St. Petersburg for the season-ending series later than expected Sunday night after their plane had to divert to Jacksonville because of a fire in the galley.They officially clinched at least a wild-card berth when the Los Angeles Angels lost the second game of a doubleheader to the Texas Rangers late Sunday and manager Buck Showalter coaches and players celebrated by having a short meeting and toasting the accomplishment at the team hotel.Weve clinched a spot but weve got an opportunity to win the East. Thats big Jones said before the game. You get to put up a banner at Camden Yards. It speaks something about the team. It means you finished ahead of the Yankees and Boston and Tampa Bay everybody.Cobb retired 10 in a row before Hardy singled between shortstop and third base for Baltimores first hit. The 24-year-old right-hander walked Jim Thome with one out in the fifth and Nate McLouth with one out in the sixth. McLouth stole second but was stranded when J.J. Hardy grounded to shortstop and Chris Davis took a third called strike.Wieters career-high 23rd homer home run cleared the short wall in the left-field corner known as 162 Landing the spot where Evan Longoria hit the 12th-inning homer that the sent the Rays to the playoffs on the final night of last season.It is frustrating when its out of your hands but we put ourselves in that position. We could have held our own destiny Cobb said. Even coming into the last road trip we had that chance but we let a couple slip that we wish we could have had back but were doing all we can now with what we have.While Maddon is hoping for another dramatic finish the manager said he wont fret if the Rays fall short of earning their fourth berth in five seasons.Honestly it just is what it is. We had opportunities early in the year to win more games and we did not. But so did everybody else Maddon said.Everybody else is going to be bemoaning the same points if they dont get there at this juncture. So for me its about staying right here keeping the blinders on. Its about moving it forward organizationally speaking. Weve stil got a heartbeat. Lets see what happens. I expect to come out (Tuesday) with another game that means something.NOTES: Chen whos 0-4 over seven starts since last winning on Aug. 19 hasnt won since Aug. 19 allowed four runs � three of them unearned � and six hits in 6 2-3 innings. ... Zobrist joined B.J. Upton as the only Rays with at least 20 homers. He has driven in 21 runs in 28 games since the start of September. ... Baltimore RHP Jason Hammel (sore right knee) threw five innings in the Florida instructional league and could be available to pitch for the Orioles late this week. ... Orioles RF Nick Markakis (broken left thumb) will have surgically-inserted pins removed in a week.	3	3	4	2	5	5	2	2	2	4	2	3	1	3	3
NEW YORK (AP) � For a short time this fall Broadway will feature Frankie Valli in two different places.There will be the fake one taking the stage of the August Wilson Theatre for the Tony-winning Jersey Boys and the real one appearing for seven nights at the Broadway Theater with The Four Seasons beginning Oct. 19.The 78-year old Valli has been belting iconic hits like Cant Take My Eyes Off You and Sherry with his trademark falsetto for years. Recently the New Jersey native spoke to The Associated Press about his career a stint on The Sopranos and where to get the best corned beef sandwich in New York.___AP: Whats special about playing Broadway this fall?Valli: I cant think of anybody who had a play on Broadway about their life and appeared on Broadway at the same time so it was something that I was trying to get happening for a couple years and unable to get anybody to really understand what I was talking about.AP: Since recording technology was far less sophisticated when you started out how important was it to emotionally deliver the song in the studio?Valli: The first and most important part about having a hit record is something that I learned a long long time ago. You needed to have a hit song in order to have a hit record. If you didnt have a hit song it didnt matter how great the performance was or the arrangement or the production � you didnt have a hit record. Thats just the way it was. It didnt matter if your name was Frank Sinatra or James Brown. It just didnt matter. Every artist has misses. You hopefully go into the studio and do music that your audience is going to like but that does mean theyre gonna like everything that you make and sometimes you can run out of ideas.AP: How did The Four Seasons approach it?Valli: I always looked at The Four Seasons as being more of an innovative group for the kind of music that they did. We really never followed what was happening on the radio. We werent listening to what was happening on the radio. We went in and made music that we loved to do. We had fun doing it. I think when you start to sit down and try to figure out what is it that makes the hit is when you begin to have trouble.AP: What was it about The Four Seasons and that era?Valli: It was a very strange phenomenon because we were a guys group and girls liked what we did but in a lot of cases there were groups that guys didnt like because they felt they were being threatened. We were not that. We were saying a lot of things that these street guys wanted to say.AP: When did you realize you wanted to be a recording artist?Valli: I first started out in this business not really wanting to be a pop singer. I was more interested in jazz. Thats what I wanted to do. And I remember as a kid I would sit in the kitchen on the floor � we lived in the projects � with the door open to the outside and Id listen to Symphony Sid which was on the radio from 12 at night until 6 in the morning. My father would go bananas so I had to keep it so low.AP: What led you to your trademark falsetto vocals?Valli: A lot of groups did. They just used falsetto a little differently than they did. We used it as a lead-in. We used it much stronger. Everybody else used it as background. In a lot of cases we used it as background too. I sang lead and then when we were making the record I sang a high background part with it.AP: At what point did you know you were onto something?Valli: To be perfectly honest with you at first when I decided to do pop music I wasnt overly excited you know? I was trying to do this jazz thing. Jazz wasnt really happening to any great degree. Listening to the radio one day I said Hell I can do this too.AP: What would we be surprised to learn that you listen to?Valli: I like country music I like jazz and I like blues. (Bob) Dylan is probably one of my all-time favorite favorite people that there is. Probably Americas greatest poet. Ive always seen him as that. As (Bruce) Springsteen is the other side of Dylan. Dylan brings out everything thats wrong in the world and Springsteen he finds things that are good.AP: What was it like playing Rusty Millio on the Sopranos?Valli: I loved it. Its a part of my life that was really a part of my life although I was never mobbed up. I grew up in New Jersey. I lived in a neighborhood where there was a presence of organized crime... but all the clubs and bars that everybody worked in were owned by these guys. So I got to know everybody.AP: What did you have for lunch?Valli: We went for a corned beef sandwich on Houston Street � Katz Deli. The secret isnt in not how much meat it is. I dont know if you noticed but they cut it with a knife. It doesnt cut on a machine because it just crumbles. There are no places that do it like that anymore. They undercook it in most places because they get more sandwiches out of it. You overcook it and it shrinks. But thats the only way it tastes just right.___Online: http://www.frankievallionbroadway.com___John Carucci covers entertainment for The Associated Press.

CHICAGO (AP) � The Cincinnati Reds became the first team in the majors to clinch a playoff spot this season beating the Chicago Cubs 5-3 Thursday while manager Dusty Baker remained in a hospital after being diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat.Ace Johnny Cueto and the NL Central leaders ensured themselves of at least a wild-card spot. Cincinnati cut its magic number to two for winning the division for the second time in three years.The Reds said Baker would remain in a Chicago hospital for an additional day so doctors could monitor his progress. He left Wrigley Field before Wednesday nights game and underwent another test Thursday.Baker is hoping to return to Cincinnati on Friday. Bench coach Chris Speier ran the team for a second straight game.Cueto (18-9) pitched six shutout innings as the Red completed a three-game sweep.The Reds broke a scoreless tie by getting five straight singles off reliever Manuel Corpas (0-2) in the seventh during a five-run rally capped by Henry Rodriguezs two-run double.Chicago starter Jason Berken allowed just two hits in six innings against a lineup missing most of the Reds regulars.Cueto gave up five hits with four walks and broke a three-game losing streak.The Cubs scored in the seventh on Anthony Rizzos RBI single and in the eighth on Welington Castillos fifth homer again. Rizzo had an RBI grounder in the ninth against Alfredo Simon who pitched the final 1 1-3 innings for his first save in as many chances.The Reds secured their second playoff appearance in three years despite having the back of their bullpen wiped out by injuries during spring training and losing their best hitter � 2010 National League MVP Joey Votto � for nearly two months.Baker did some of his best managing to pull them through.His first challenge was cobbling together a bullpen after closer Ryan Madson tore an elbow ligament in spring training ending his season. Setup men Nick Masset and Bill Bray also got hurt before the season opened.Baker eased Aroldis Chapman into the closers role and the hard-throwing left-hander set a franchise record with 27 consecutive saves.Baker also had to juggle his batting order and lineup after Votto tore knee cartilage and was sidelined on July 16. The Reds went on their best tear of the season without their top hitter going 32-16 and taking control of the NL Central.There was some good fortune too. All five starters have made it through the season without injury a franchise record. The Reds had to use a sixth starter only because of a doubleheader.By the time September started the Reds were firmly in control and counting down the days until theyd clinch.NOTES: Cuetos two strikeouts gave him a career-best 159. ... Reds 2B Rodriguez and CF Denis Phipps made their first career starts and SS Didi Gregorius started for just the fourth time. ... The Cubs stay home to play the wild card-contending Cardinals with Chris Carpenter (0-0) set to make his season debut against Chris Volstad (3-10). ... The Reds will start Bronson Arroyo (12-8) at home against the Dodgers Joe Blanton (9-13) on Friday night. ... Berken picked up on waivers from Baltimore earlier this month struck out four batters in one inning � the fifth Cubs pitcher to ever do that � when Ryan Hanigan reached on a third strike wild pitch in the second.___AP Sports Writer Joe Kay contributed to this report.	2	2	4	3	3	3	2	2	2	3	2	3	3	2	2
WARWICK R.I. (AP) � The owner of a foul-mouthed cockatoo in Rhode Island who was slapped with a $15 fine for violating a noise ordinance is appealing.The Providence Journal reports (bit.ly/RUIVG4) that Warwick resident Lynne Taylor is appealing to a state court a fine imposed by a municipal judge. The judge said Taylor had broken a local law that prohibits residents from letting their pets habitually howl bark or make other noise.Taylors lawyer says the ordinance is unconstitutional because it gives no parameters for what noise constitutes a violation. He notes the statute says that if someone is annoyed its a public nuisance.A neighbor accused Taylors bird of parroting vulgar phrases cursing and loudly speaking expletives.

(First fourth and fifth answers contain profanity)LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Arbitrage Nicholas Jareckis indie drama about a high-powered New York hedge fund mogul (Richard Gere) enduring self-inflicted calamities on both personal and professional levels opened on Friday and racked up exceptionally good business over its first three days. It grossed more than $2 million on fewer than 200 screens the best-ever showing for a film that opened in theaters day-and-date with VOD.One of the screenings that didnt go on the ledger took place at the Academys Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills on Saturday night where the film played to a nearly full house and reportedly won a strong reaction from the Oscar voters in attendance.Gere has never been nominated for an Oscar despite a 37-year career in film and hes facing an uphill battle this year in a very crowded Best Actor category. But hes sly and quietly commanding as a wealthy trader whose world is on the verge of collapsing as a risky business deal goes bad and a midnight drive with his mistress turns deadly.You dont work very often. Why did you do this film?Its just a beautifully written script beautifully structured. And it deals with a world that we all want to know more about. Its so relevant to our happiness what those fuckers are doing.And I liked the moral ambiguity of all of the characters especially the character that Im playing. The gradations of self-awareness the empathy or lack of it.Were conditioned to want to like the main character in a movie but in the first few minutes Arbitrage gives us a laundry list of reasons why we shouldnt like this guy. Was it a challenge as an actor to keep us invested in him despite that?I could have made the choice to play this character as more of a Bernie Madoff or even darker. I mean a real villain. But that wasnt interesting to me or to Nick. It was too easy and if I did that I dont think youd be invested in him as you say. Although you dont like what the guy does youve gotta take the trip with him.Its like with Bill Clinton. You know hes got problems but hes our Clinton. Its like Hes so lovable hes so smart hes cute hes boyish ...  It was more important for me to get all the cylinders working on that part as well as the machinations of what a Machiavellian guy in the financial world is capable of.So Madoff and Clinton were the touchstones?At the time we made this Madoff was the elephant in the room. Since then some characters have emerged who are more like this guy. Jamie Dimon is much more like this character than Madoff - hes a reputable charming guy who just lost $9 billion of someone elses money.And Ted Kennedy. Chappaquiddick. I thought Wow this is a really potent combination: power with flaws big ideas. Really Shakespeare-sized stuff here.A Shakespearean tragic hero though would end up dead. Your guy meets a much more ambiguous fate.There was a certain faction including the director that thought this guy was fucked. We had arguments about that. They said His wife owns him and thats it - shes gonna leave him and take everything. I said No fucking way. Look at where Clinton is today. Thats the route hes gonna take: Hes gonna rope-a-dope for a while. Hes gonna take the punches and do his mea culpas.Look none of these people want to change their lives. is a woman totally invested in this guy and his world and she loves him. Look at Hillary Clinton. She could have taken a totally different route but I think she went with her heart. She said I love the guy I know he messed up but hes my Bill. And I think Susans character will ultimately do the same thing.The character has a sense of invulnerability as do a lot of people in that position. Theres a feeling that things can be screwed up but theres a way out of this.Absolutely. Theyre very confident: I can make this work and Im not going to lose. I spent time with those guys and thats very much the mentality I wanted to feel on a visceral level. I see that with politicians too.I remember that I used to do this real cowboy stuff in Nevada. We would move horses from the north pasture the summer pasture to the winter pasture and back again. Itd be 10 days and youd be out there moving 150 horses. A lot of fun. But you hoped for that moment when one horse would take off you know? We were all good at what we did keeping the horses in line and moving along but we were so happy when one horse said fuck it and ran. Because everyone could get crazy then: Lets go get em boys!I think thats part of the mentality. You never put it on the resume that you had a problem but it gets your blood up.How big a concern was it that the director had never directed before?Huge. But he knows this world and he wrote that script so I knew that he can tell stories. You make a bet.Did his inexperience show during the shoot?Sure. He didnt know exactly where to put the camera he didnt know what lens but he hired really good people who know how to do that. He didnt know how to talk to actors because hed never been through it before. And he couldnt really demonstrate to them because hes not a good actor.But he was good at keeping his energy up and the stress level never buried him. It buries a lot of people.Do you assume a slightly different role in a case like this? Slightly. Im always involved anyhow but here I was translating to actors what he wanted. I could help him say things in a way that would communicate to an actor and not obfuscate. Its easy to confuse someone - an actor especially. So sometimes I was just the interpreter saying This is what he means in the native language.Youve talked about the tie between your character and politicians. What are your thoughts on the current campaign? Im very happy that Obamas ahead. Im pleased by that and I will be voting for him without a doubt.Will you be campaigning or speaking out?I dont think theres any need. Its not for me its for the president to tell the American people what hes going to do and explain to them in a way that theyll feel it.	4	5	4	4	4	3	2	4	4	2	4	3	3	3	4

DENVER - Mitt Romney today accused President Obama of trying to fool voters into thinking Romney believes in things he does not telling reporters aboard his campaign plane that Obama is running on talking points he knows are wrong.The president will not be able to continue to mischaracterize my pathway said Romney in answering a question about the importance of the upcoming debates. Ill continue to describe mine he will describe his and people will make a choice. Thats the great thing about democracy.Im not going to try to fool people into thinking he believes things he doesnt Romney said. Hes trying to fool people into thinking that I think things that I dont. And that ends at the debates.Romneys press conference came after a rough week for the candidate and is the first sign of an attempt by the candidate to turn around the campaign which is set to make stops in the battleground states of Colorado Ohio and Virginia before the weeks end.Asked by ABC News which issues he specifically thinks the President is trying to fool voters about or which particularly get to him Romney rattled off a list: the auto maker bailout taxes and social issues.Theyre not that they particularly get to me but I think that theyre inaccurate said Romney.Romney said nothing could be further from the truth when Obama says he supported liquidating the auto industry.My plan was to rebuild the auto industry and take it through bankruptcy so that could happen and by the way he doesnt mention he took them through bankruptcy Romney said.Romney said Obama accuses him of being in favor of lowering taxes on wealthy people.No Im not Romney said. Im not going to reduce the taxes on the wealthy at all in fact I want to lower taxes on middle income people. He says I want to raise them on middle income people - thats completely inaccurate.And on abortion Obamas wrong on that too Romney said.He says Im opposed to abortion even in cases of rape and incest Romney said. Thats wrong.One ad after another of his ad statements has been determined to be factually inaccurate Romney said. And you know I understand that politics is politics but in the past when youve had an ad which has been roundly pointed out to be wrong you take it out and you correct it and put something back on. He keeps running these things even though he knows theyre wrong and saying them in rallies even though he knows theyre wrong.When asked if he doesnt think its vital for him to win the first debate which is just over a week away Romney declined to get into the stakes of the debates.I dont expect this to be a contest of who can say the cutest phrase I think its a contest of very different directions for the country he answered.The Obama campaign in a statement following Romneys remarks said that its odd Romney wont take personal responsibility for his campaigns troubles adding that it takes a lot of chutzpah to shed crocodile tears over a legitimate discussion of his record and policies.Here are the facts: if Mitt Romney had had his way and wed let Detroit go bankrupt GM and Chrysler would no longer be in business today. He would raise taxes on middle class families to pay for tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires said Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith. And he endorsed the Republican Party platform that would ban abortion even in the cases of rape and incest. If hes so offended by his own positions maybe he shouldnt have taken them in the first place.	4	3	4	3	3	4	2	3	3	2	3	4	1	3	3

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Health providers should screen all adults and pregnant women for risky drinking habits a government-backed expert panel said Monday in new draft recommendations.The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines were released along with a summary of past research showing a few brief counseling sessions can help cut excessive drinking in people who arent full-blown alcoholics.Researchers found that with such interventions at least one in every ten risky drinkers can be brought back down to what is considered a safe drinking level.For men that means no more than four drinks on any one occasion and at most 14 a week. For women the numbers are three and seven respectively.The really good interventions incorporate self-help materials they incorporate an action plan made by the doctor and the patient - theyre not just a prescription said Dr. Daniel Jonas of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who led the research review but is not part of the USPSTF.Its estimated that about one in three Americans drink too much. Most of the misuse is known as risky or hazardous drinking which doesnt involve physical dependence or diseases but nonetheless has been linked to accidents and premature deaths.The new draft recommendations repeat the USPSTFs previous position from 2004 noting that the evidence is still insufficient to give advice regarding adolescents.They are based on the research update from Jonas and colleagues which included 23 trials of alcohol counseling each trial had anywhere from 72 to more than 1500 people and lasted from six to 48 months.One of the most effective screening techniques is simply asking a person if he or she has had five or more drinks on any one occasion over the past year said Jonas.If the answer is yes the health provider should gauge the level of misuse. If its limited to risky use not yet causing direct physical or mental harm then a few counseling sessions with the doctor can be helpful.The poster-child for these interventions was two visits with the primary care doctor each one about 10 to 15 minutes and about a month apart and each one with a follow-up call from a nurse to reinforce the behavior Jonas told Reuters Health.He and his colleagues found such interventions cut the average weekly alcohol use by 3.6 drinks on average compared with no intervention. They also reduced binge drinking by 12 percentage points and risky drinking by 11 percentage points.That means nine people would need to be counseled for one to cut back to safe drinking levels. And that might even be an underestimate of the true benefit of counseling said Jonas. Thats because even people who didnt get counseling had been screened making them aware they drank too much and possibly leading them to cut back.Screening and counseling has little potential to do harm according to the researcher. Still there is no proof that drinking less actually leads to fewer accidents or deaths which is why the task force gave the recommendation a grade B instead of a A.Jonas acknowledged that with about a fifth of Americans being risky drinkers a universal screening program could be pricey. While Medicare reimburses doctors for it its time out of the calendar for both patients and health providers.That is really the biggest challenge with implementing this Jonas said adding that UNC is in the process of training its doctors to do the screening.Training is a big piece of it too because a lot of providers need to learn how to do it the researcher said.The USPSTFs draft guidelines are open for public comments until October 22.SOURCE: http://bit.ly/TeYLw9 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and http://bit.ly/N0G6LY Annals of Internal Medicine online September 24 2012.	3	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	4	2	3	2	2	2	3
MONTEREY Calif. � The worlds oceans are getting more acidic a phenomenon predicted to wreak havoc on most sea life. But some organisms are performing better in these caustic conditions than researchers had anticipated raising questions about what the oceans will look like in the future.We know evolution can occur on relatively short ecological timescales said Gretchen Hofmann a biologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara at the Third International Symposium on the Oceans in a High CO2 World meeting last week. She added that the big remaining question is which species will survive and which wont be able to cope.As carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere (as a result of burning fossil fuels) about a quarter of that atmospheric carbon makes its way into the oceans where it dissolves and makes the waters more acidic. Currently because of this process the oceans are about 30 percent more acidic than they were at the start of the industrial revolution.Species that make shells out of calcium carbonate are particularly compromised in acidic waters where the carbonate ions needed for shell-making are not available. But other ocean-dwellers that rely on protein instead of calcium carbonate to create shells fare better. For instance small crablike arthropods about the size of sand fleas actually increase productivity in extremely acidified water said Kristy Kroeker a biology doctoral student at Stanford University. These are rapidly growing small-bodied creatures with larvae that crawl instead of swim and they actually do very well Kroeker told LiveScience. [Spectacular Photos of Sea Creatures]Hofmanns lab has found that purple sea urchins are able to cope with highly acidic waters probably because of the amount of genetic diversity within the species. The group collected sea urchins from a spot off the Oregon coast that has naturally high acidity from the upwelling of deep ocean water. In the lab the researchers compared the genetic data of these urchins when raised at high-acidity and normal-acidity conditions finding 150 genes turned on that helped the urchins move calcium around their systems.In addition to urchins some corals tolerate the changing oceans better than others. Katharina Fabricius a coral reef ecologist with the Australian Institute of Marine Science said that colorful branching coral cant cope with higher temperatures and ocean acidity but massive boulder corals and sea grasses survived in these conditions. Fabricius has worked in Papua New Guinea along vents that bubble carbon dioxide into shallow water giving a good experimental lab to researchers looking at future ocean conditions. [Photos of Colorful Corals]Her research suggests these reefs will still exist in 100 years. But they would be much more simple. The complex species are unable to deal with high carbon dioxide situations she said. Reefs are hope to hundreds of thousands of species and replacing the branching coral � with its myriad nooks and crannies for habitat � with boulder coral means a drop in biodiversity. If you dont have the structure you dont have the habitat Fabricius said.Other parts of the world share a similar story. Kroeker works in carbon-dioxide-bubbling vents off the coast of Italy. As waters become more acidic there Kroeker explained fewer patches of bright orange-and-pink algae can survive. Instead we see lots of fleshy seaweed. It looks like a dark mat on the seafloor. Kroeker�s 2010 meta-analysis detailed in the journal Ecology Letters also showed that crustaceans generally do better than other calcium-carbonate shell-making creatures. Some lobsters prawns and crabs actually increase their shell-building when faced with more acidic waters.Even different algae species differ in their responses to ocean acidification. Dave Hutchins a marine biologist at UCLA said that harmful algae blooms like those that cause red tides are likely to produce more toxins in future ocean conditions.These blooms cost around $100 million per year in the U.S. alone and may get more toxic in the future Hutchins told LiveScience adding that theyre a special problem on the West Coast sea lions washing up around the LA area were poisoned by algae called Pseudo-nitzschia that produce a powerful neurotoxin that leads to memory loss nerve damage and death.A group of cyanobacteria called Trichodesmium that turn atmospheric nitrogen into a form other organisms can use for growth are also winners. His lab has looked at hundreds of generations of algae and found that they produce far more nitrogen in high carbon-dioxide (CO2) conditions.For hundreds of generations we grow them under lab conditions and their production of nitrogen goes way up under high CO2 he said.Hutchins said he also found the algae couldnt scale back their nitrogen production even when the carbon dioxide level drops. Theyre stuck in an on position and were trying to understand what that means in terms of marine food chains he said.Ocean acidification also interferes with some fishs ability to sense predators. One bit of research presented at the conference showed that juvenile clownfish lost their ability to sniff out predators in high carbon-dioxide environments.	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	3
NEW YORK � Arctic sea-ice extent shrank to an unprecedented low this summer part of a long-term decline in the icy white cap over the far northern ocean.Researchers predict that nearly ice-free summers are on the way although it�s not yet clear when this will happen. This shift has implications for climate � in particular it is expected to aggravate global warming � and for the animals such as polar bears and walruses which depend on the ice for habitat.But the loss of ice over the Arctic Ocean also opens up the possibility for increased shipping tourism oil and gas exploration and fishing. But this potential development raises challenges with which nations will have to grapple said Anne Siders a postdoctoral researcher with the Columbia Center for Climate Change Law to an audience at Columbia University Wednesday (Sept. 19).Siders was among a panel of researchers who discussed the science behind the declining sea ice the suite of changes occurring in the Arctic and public perception of it. [10 Things You Need to Know About Arctic Sea Ice]A predictably open Arctic Ocean creates opportunities and challenges for nations that ring the Arctic. Here are some of them.The opportunities:Fishing: Warming ocean temperatures migrating fish and changes in sea ice may create conditions favorable to the development of new commercial fisheries within the Arctic according to the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A U.S. plan approved in 2009 temporarily prohibits commercial fishing in U.S. Arctic waters until more information is available.More ship traffic: A journey through the Northwest Passage north of Canada or along the Northern sea route over Russia can cut thousands of miles off a trip that could otherwise require a ship to travel through the Panama Canal or the Suez Canal. Between 1906 and 2006 only 69 ships traveled through the Northwest Passage said Michael Byers professor of political science at the University of British Columbia in a recent article in the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. In 2010 18 traveled through and in 2011 22 made the trip. As ice in the passage has dwindled tourist trips on cruise ships and private yachts has increased the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reports.Gas and oil: The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimated in 2008 that the Arctic holds a wealth of undiscovered energy reserves: 90 billion of barrels of oil 1670 trillion cubic feet (47.3 trillion cubic meters) of natural gas and 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids �most of it offshore. The quest for these resources is underway in spite of setbacks. The oil company Shell announced on Monday(Sept. 17) it was delaying until next year plans to drill off the Alaskan Arctic coast. The loss of ice would make this prospecting easier.The problems:Inadequate maps: The increase in traffic brings up a navigation problem. NOAAs maps and other navigational information are unavailable or outdated in parts of the Arctic Ocean because thick impenetrable sea ice kept ships out. In addition most Arctic waters that are charted were surveyed using obsolete technology dating back to the 1800s according to NOAA.Little infrastructure or support: Alaska has twice the length of coastline as the lower 48 states but the U.S. Coast Guard has extremely limited resources to devote to search-and-rescue operations or to oil spill cleanup Siders said. Admiral Robert Papp the Coast Guard commandant has been quoted in the media as saying The Coast Guard has zero capability in the Arctic. � If we are going to have a permanent presence there its going to require some investment. We dont have the infrastructure in place right now. As an example of when things go wrong: In 2010 a cruise ship called the MV Clipper Adventurer ran aground in the Northwest Passage and its passengers had to be rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard. [Disasters at Sea: 6 Deadliest Shipwrecks]Territorial disagreements: The Arctic coastal nations the United States Canada Russia Norway and Denmark (Greenland is a Danish territory) are seeking to lay claim to territory far out over the continental shelves but the United States cant lay its own claim and has little say in others� because the U.S. is not a party to the U.N. Law of the Sea Treaty CNN Money reports. There are other territorial issues as well for instance Canada maintains that the Northwest Passage is sovereign Canadian territory while other nations including the U.S. maintain that it is an international strait.The loss of summer ice will not however transform the Arctic into the Caribbean.�Some of the challenges to operating in the Arctic are and have been the same for a very long time� Siders said adding these will remain at least to some degree requiring people to work �in the dark in the cold in the middle of a storm� as earlier arrivals have done before.Follow LiveScience on Twitter @livescience.

OLYMPIA Washington (Reuters) - The Seattle City Council on Monday voted 6-2 in favor of an arena financing deal with hedge fund manager and aspiring NBA franchise owner Chris Hansen that aims to lure the NBA back to the city.The Pacific Northwest city lost the Seattle SuperSonics to Oklahoma City in 2008 where the team was renamed the Thunder after the owner faulted city officials for not coming up with a plan to build a new arena.The teams departure after four decades in Seattle angered basketball fans in the city and officials are trying to bring back the National Basketball Association to town.This is about a can-do spirit looking to the future and grabbing the opportunities that are being presented to our city said Councilman Tim Burgess who voted in favor of the financing deal.The arena deal builds on a memorandum of understanding struck in May to require an outlay of up to $200 million in public bonds to help pay for the $490 million project.That agreement was struck between hedge fund manager Chris Hansen Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn and King County Executive Dow Constantine.The public bonds would be repaid by taxes and rent payments generated from the arena.This may set a new bar for deals that cities strike with pro sports teams said Seattle City Council President Sally J. Clark who voted in favor of the agreement.The two council members voting against the deal acknowledged that their colleagues had extracted relatively favorable terms from Hansen and his partners but said that it was not enough.This revised agreement may prevent the most problematic outcomes said Councilman Richard Conlin. That does not mean that we will wind up benefiting from it or that it is a good use of the citys time resources or financial capacity.The King County Council still needs to sign off on the deal before Hansen can begin shopping for a team. In a statement King County Councilman Joe McDermott said the county body was likely to do so soon.I am certain we will stand together with a final in the next few weeks McDermott said.Under the agreement Seattle officials would create a $40 million transportation fund to help offset traffic congestion in the area that could worsen with the new arena.The new terms also include at least $2 million to spruce up the SuperSonics old home Key Arena up to $5 million to help pay the rent for the WNBAs Seattle Storm should they wind up playing in the new arena and a personal financial guarantee from Hansen on paying off the arena debt.Hansen could also be required to buy the new arena for $200 million after 30 years.The deal is contingent on an environmental assessment of the project that will include an exploration of alternate sites.Hansen has spent millions of dollars acquiring land near downtown for the proposed arena close to the stadiums of the Seattle Mariners baseball team and the NFLs Seattle Seahawks.Hansens plan calls for having teams from both the NBA and the National Hockey League play in the new arena but ground could be broken on the project for an NBA team alone.This is a magical day and a long time coming said Kris Brannon one of a handful of diehard green- and yellow-clad SuperSonics fans that cheered and hugged in the City Council chambers after the votes were tallied.The NBA franchise most often linked in media reports with a possible move to Seattle is the Sacramento Kings. The team previously expressed an interest in moving to Anaheim in southern California.(Editing by Tim Gaynor and Mohammad Zargham)	2	2	4	3	3	4	2	2	2	3	2	3	3	1	3
EL PASO Texas - Singer-songwriter Fiona Apple has been arrested for hashish possession at a West Texas town after a Border Patrol drug-sniffing dog detected marijuana in her tour bus.Hudspeth County sheriffs office spokesman Rusty Flemming says Apple spent Wednesday night in the county jail and was released Thursday on a $10000 bond.Fleming says Apple had a little tiny amount of pot and hash. Fleming says marijuana possession in small amounts is a misdemeanour while hashish in any quantity is a felony in Texas.Apples publicist Ambrosia Healy didnt immediately respond to an email request for comment.The Sierra Blanca checkpoint inspects thousands of vehicles daily and sends the town thousands of drug cases yearly. Willie Nelson Snoop Dogg and actor Armand Hammer have been arrested in Sierra Blanca on marijuana charges.	2	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	2	3	2	1	3	2
(Reuters) - Competitive rowers and cross-country skiers may not have any more chronic lower back pain than the rest of us despite putting constant stress on their backs according to a Norwegian study.Elite athletes in certain sports that ask a lot of the spine such as gymnastics and wrestling have been found to have an increased risk of lower back pain. Rowers and cross-country skiers dont have to bend themselves backwards but they do have to flex and extend their spines over and over again.They expose their backs to monotonous movements for a number of years said lead researcher Ida Stange Foss at the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences in Oslo whose study was published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine.Yet in the long run Fosss team found elite rowers and skiers may have no more lower back woes than people who get their sports from TV.Of 415 former rowers and cross-country skiers surveyed about 56 percent said theyd had any lower back pain in the past year. That compared with 53 percent of non-athletes a difference that could have been due to chance.This is an important and positive message for the athletes Foss said in an email.But there were variations. Rowers and skiers whod trained harder in the past year more than 550 hours were also more likely to have had a bout of low back pain in the past year although the pain was generally short-lived.The study included 173 rowers and 242 cross-country skiers whod been surveyed back in 2000. Fosss team surveyed them again in 2010 asking about their training and exercise levels over the past decade and any problems with back pain.For comparison the researchers surveyed 116 non-athletes and 209 athletes in orienteering a sport that involves outdoor running and no specific strain on the back.Other studies have found that when it comes to exercise and back pain extremes matter. Both couch potatoes and heavy-training athletes may be at increased risk.Back in the 2000 survey of these same athletes the researchers did find that lower back pain became more common as rowers and skiers bumped up their training to get ready for competition.Cross-country skiers had more pain when they used classic techniques rather than freestyle Foss added.These findings indicate that it is important to vary movement patterns and techniques especially during intense training periods she said.

The song: Skyfall the latest blockbuster in the James Bond franchise wont be released in the U.S. until Nov. 9 but now eager fans can get an early audio sample of the super-spys upcoming adventure. A portion of Skyfall the breathlessly awaited theme song by Bristish songstress Adele has hit the internet � and earlier than expected. (Listen to Skyfall below.) The single was originally slotted for release Thursday evening but the first 90 seconds leaked days early. Let the sky fall when it crumbles we will stand tall and face it all together Adele sings in the clip which is smoother and jazzier than the rock-infused themes that have featured in Daniel Craigs past 007 films.The reaction: Skyfall is a Bond song that actually stirs the heart says Neil McCormick at the Daily Telegraph. Yes its a beautiful ballad that promises to become a Bondian classic Ajay Chowdhury of the James Bond International Fan Club tells the UK Press Association. The pairing of singer and film seemed perfect at the outset says Katey Rich at CinemaBlend and this clip proves it: The soulful Skyfall hearkens back to classic James Bond themes like Goldfinger signaling that the era of classic Bond should be back with a vengeance when Skyfall hits theaters.

The twitchy tentacles of a sundew can catapult prey into the carnivorous plants sticky traps in a fraction of a second researchers say.These fast-moving snares are among the quickest seen yet in the plant kingdom the scientists added.Researchers investigated a sundew plant from southern Australia Drosera glanduligera whose flower trap grows up to 1.5 inches (4 centimeters) wide. Sundews get their name from the sticky drops resembling the morning dew at the end of each of their tentacles. Carnivorous plants such as sundews go after meat to help them survive in the nutrient-poor soils they call home.Past research showed D. glanduligera has a way of ensnaring prey that is unique among carnivorous plants. In addition to its sticky tentacles this sundew possesses longer touch-sensitive tentacles that can snap forward hurling insects at its flypaper-like glue traps. The sticky tentacles then slowly bend to move the prey to spoon-shaped leaves from where it is slowly digested.Although the fast snap tentacles were basically known for decades they received only very little attention from the scientific community said researcher Thomas Speck a biophysicist at the University of Freiburg in Germany. [Image Gallery: Wacky Carnivorous Plants]To show for the first time how these tentacles work scientists collaborated with private sundew cultivators. They analyzed these plants with microscopes and high-speed video cameras in the lab testing the sundews with fruit flies.D. glanduligera is not only extremely tough to cultivate by needing high-temperature fluctuations between day (above 20 degrees C) and night (close to zero degrees C) and regular feeding with flaked fish food and fruit flies it also grows for only a few months from germination until seed production and wilting wrote researcher Simon Poppinga a botanist at the University of Freiburg in Germany in an email. We hence had a very small time slot to accomplish all experiments needed. In Fahrenheit that temperature range is 68 to 32 degrees.The secret to the quick tentacles probably involves releasing pent-up hydraulic pressure in a sudden burst the researchers found. And it happens fast. The sundew takes about 75 milliseconds to catapult prey with snap tentacles which is by far the fastest motion reported from the sundew genus Speck told LiveScience. It is quick enough to outsmart walking prey animals and is a bit faster than the snap-trapping action of the famous and closely related Venus flytrap and waterwheel plant.However the title of fastest predator in the plant kingdom belongs to another plant the bladderwort Utricularia which features traps that suck in their prey in less than a millisecond Poppinga said.These snap tentacles are each one-shot weapons with their hinges essentially breaking after they catapult the researchers found. The sundew grows fast developing new leaves every three to four days so losing a snap tentacle to get food is apparently worth it.The researchers suggest the snap tentacles extend the range of each plant beyond just their glue traps and perhaps help them capture larger animals that might ordinarily be strong enough to free themselves from a sticky tentacle.Future research will endeavor to see how these carnivorous plants behave outside the lab in the wild and what prey they catch. Fruit flies are definitely not the main prey in the natural habitat Speck said.The scientists detailed their findings online Sept. 26 in the journal PLoS ONE.	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	3	3	1	1	1	4
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton advocates for what she calls twenty-first century statecraft the use of technology and social media by ambassadors and their staff to connect and engage with their local communities. But can Facebook and Twitter really change the art of diplomacy?[More from Mashable: 25 Dead Presidents to Follow on Twitter]That was one question posed to Deputy Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs for Digital Strategy at the State Department Victoria Esser Indonesian Ambassador to the United States Dr. Dino Patti Djalal Mexican Ambassador to the United States Arturo Sarukhan Casamitjana and American Ambassador to Zimbabwe Charles Ray during a panel at the 2012 Social Good Summit.[Social media] is an integral part of how were conducting our diplomacy around the world said Esser. We have 300 Twitter profiles 400 Facebook pages. To me its about creating virtuous circles online and offline -- nothing will replace face-to-face diplomacy but social media is an important way to connect with people and cut away time distance and diplomatic rank barriers and have a real conversation.[More from Mashable: 6 Pinterest Analytics Tools to Supercharge Your Influence]Esser pointed to a recent State Department experiment with Google Hangouts as an example of such a conversation.Earlier this year we did a Google Hangout in Persian said Esser. We were trying to figure out a way to really engage in a dialogue in Iran where we dont have a diplomatic presence.Esser subtly acknowledging the situation at the American Embassy in Cairo wherein a staffer sent tweets later reported to have gone without authorization also said that Washington largely gives individual missions free reign to tweet as they will.Weve devolved [control] so missions in the field are responsible with general guidance from Washington. You cant manage a tweet at a time and its important not to or it wont be authentic to the community youre trying to engage with. We recognize there will be bumps along the road but as my colleague Alec Ross points out the twenty-first century is a terrible time to be a control freak. If you want to engage in this dialogue theres a certain loss in control involved.Ambassador Ray shared a unique story of using Facebook to circumvent a local governments obstructionism.When the government discovered our face-to-face meetings with young people were having an effect ... they started disrupted meetings. They hated it with a passion. So we came up with alternative which was a wild suggestion at the time: A live Facebook chat along with SMS Twitter and YouTube. In the first one 200 people enrolled and we had 250 comments in the first 30 minutes.Facebook didnt replace face-to-face diplomacy but it filled a gap it became a tool we could use to do face-to-face diplomacy when that wasnt available.For Ambassador Djalal Twitter especially has become a crucial mechanism for interacting with Indonesians at home and in the United States.If not for social media Id have no other medium to reach out to [Indonesians] said Djalal who only started tweeting when he first became an ambassador. I recently made a tweet. . .I have about 10000 followers. I said if you want to give me a gift for my birthday do one act of kindness.

NEW YORK (AP) � Barbra Streisand Aretha Franklin and Liza Minnelli took turns singing songs by the late Marvin Hamlisch during a stirring memorial service for the composer on Tuesday.Minnelli sang If You Really Knew Me from the musical Theyre Playing My Song Franklin gave a soulful rendition of Nobody Does It Better from the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me and Streisand brought the crowd to its feet when she finished The Way We Were from the film of the same name.The composers wife of 26 years Terre Hamlisch welcomed the crowd.These are Marvins melodies she said. Marvin Hamlisch lives in them. This is who Marvin Hamlisch was.Hamlisch composed or arranged hundreds of scores for musicals and movies including A Chorus Line on Broadway and the films The Sting Sophies Choice Ordinary People and The Way We Were. He died on Aug. 6 in Los Angeles at age 68 after a short illness.Streisand who wore all black and sat on a stool said she first met Hamlisch in 1963 when he was her rehearsal pianist in her breakout Broadway show Funny Girl. He also was tasked with getting everyone coffee.Since Streisand didnt drink coffee he would bring her chocolate doughnuts.He always brought me two and so our love affair began Streisand said as the crowd laughed.Their lives would intersect in personal and professional ways over the years. She sang his The Way We Were to a Grammy Award win in 1974 and he played at her wedding in 1998.Franklin in a white suit changed some of the lyrics to the sexy James Bond song Nobody Does It Better to Marvin you were the best. Hamlisch had co-written the No. 1 R&B hit Break It to Me Gently with Carole Bayer Sager for Franklin.Minnelli in a beaded dress said she met Hamlisch when she was 14 and he was 15 and they became friends immediately. He later arranged many of Minnellis albums including her first two as well as Judy Garland & Liza Minnelli Live at the London Palladium.He was one of my few constants she said getting teary on stage. He was always there. He always was and always will be.There were few seats available in the 900-seat theater at The Juilliard School where decades before Hamlisch had become its youngest person accepted at just age 7. His widow urged the crowd to fund scholarships in his memory.Hamlisch went on to became one of the most decorated artists in history winning three Oscars four Emmys four Grammys a Tony a Pulitzer and two Golden Globes.The 90-minute memorial which also boasted performances by Itzhak Perlman Michael Feinstein Chris Botti and Maria Friedman took place on a stage dominated by a huge photo of Hamlisch and two towers of flowers on either side. Performers would blow the photo kisses or bow to it after their turns on stage.In the audience were Mike Nichols the Oscar- and Tony-winning director and Valerie Jarrett a longtime adviser and friend to Barack and Michelle Obama.Hamlischs funeral was held Aug. 14 at Congregation Emanu-El a prominent Manhattan synagogue where legendary songwriter George Gershwins funeral was held in 1937. Former President Bill Clinton and Sir Howard Stringer chairman of Sony Corp. eulogized Hamlisch.Hamlisch received a Tony and a Pulitzer for A Chorus Line the second-longest-running American show in Broadway history and wrote the music for other stage hits such as The Goodbye Girl and Sweet Smell of Success.He was working on a new musical Gotta Dance at the time of his death and was scheduled to write the score for a new Steven Soderbergh film on Liberace Behind the Candelabra starring Michael Douglas and Matt Damon.The memorial also included the song While I Still Have the Time which is part of the new musical based on the Jerry Lewis film The Nutty Professor that debuted in Tennessee this summer.	3	3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	2	4	3	3	1	3
(Reuters) - Stryker Corp said on Tuesday it expanded the recall of its Neptune waste management product line to include later versions because U.S. health authorities have advised the company that these devices do not have proper regulatory clearance.In June the company issued a Class 1 recall the most serious type of its Neptune waste system after receiving two reports of serious injury and a fatality resulting from the use of the product.The company also notified customers that it was recalling the instructions for use because they did not specifically warn against connecting the high vacuum/high flow device to a passive drainage tube.In a press release Stryker a maker of hospital beds and orthopedic implants said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is unable to determine whether these last-generation devices are as safe and effective as their legally marketed predecessor the Neptune 1.(Reporting By Debra Sherman Editing by Gerald E.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Three Swiss engineers guilty of involvement in a Pakistani nuclear smuggling ring avoided a prison sentence on Tuesday after agreeing a plea bargain with the Swiss Federal Prosecutors Office.Friedrich Tinner and his two sons Marco and Urs pleaded guilty at the federal criminal court in Bellinzona of supplying centrifuge parts and participating in the smuggling ring of Abdul Qadeer Khan the former head of Pakistans nuclear programme who in 2004 was found by Pakistan to have sold nuclear secrets to North Korea Iran and Libya.However after agreeing the plea bargain the Tinner trio were handed relatively mild suspended jail sentences of between 24 and 50 months.In a long testimony Friedrich Tinner told the court on Monday about how he met A. Q. Khan in 1975 and used his business in the eastern city of St. Gallen to sell centrifuge parts for enriching uranium the online edition of Swiss tabloid Blick reported.The court also heard that Urs Tinner set up production sites in Dubai and Malaysia for producing centrifuge parts for enriching uranium while Marco took care of supplies and book-keeping.Swiss authorities started investigating Marco Tinner and his brother in 2004 confiscating thousands of documents. A year later they expanded investigations to include Friedrich Tinner.In 2009 Urs Tinner said that he had helped the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to uncover Libyas nuclear weapons programme by tipping it off that Libya was about to receive the equipment needed to make an atom bomb.It was widely reported in the Swiss media that further investigations into the Tinners were halted after the CIA urged the Swiss government to drop them to avoid exposing the extent of the agencys activities.Switzerland which is not a nuclear power is not authorized under the global Non-Proliferation Treaty to possess documents related to nuclear weaponry.

A woman loses her children her husband and both legs. A penniless family is forced to flee from Syria back to Iraq. Camps are overflowing with people and with bitterness and refugees are living in limbo without passports.As war rages in Syria the stream of refugees into other countries shows no sign of stopping. More than 100000 people fled Syria in August alone � about 40 percent of all who had left since the uprising against President Bashar Assad began last March. And the United Nations refugee agency said Thursday that the number of people escaping Syria could reach 700000 by the end of the year.Here AP reporters tell the stories of refugees and their families from four countries.__________________________TRIPOLI Lebanon � Hasna Um Abdou lost her children her husband and both legs to a mortar.Now the veiled 38-year-old woman lies in a hospital bed in this northern Lebanese city with the Quran the Muslim holy book on her table. She talks slowly with pauses and is visibly trying to hold back the tears. Abdul-Aziz 3 and Talin 13 months were her only children.Every time I remember I feel the pain she says.Um Abdou is one of thousands of Syrians who have been wounded in the uprising against Assad and its aftermath. Hundreds of the wounded have been taken for treatment in neighboring countries mostly to Lebanon Turkey and Jordan. More than 74000 Syrians have taken refuge in Lebanon itself a small country of just 4 million people that is struggling with instability.Um Abdou and her family fled their village in Homs province in March amid intense shelling to a second village and then a third. Two days later it seemed quiet and they decided to return home. The family rode back on March 31 on a motorcycle with Um Abdous daughter asleep in her arms and her son sitting in front of his father.Then her world fell apart.Um Abdou keeps hearing the sound not of the mortar but of the terror.I cannot forget the noise of the hearts beating quickly as people gathered around us she says.Her daughter died immediately from a shrapnel wound in the head. Her son bled profusely and died minutes later even as she looked at him. She did not want her husband to know the children were dead so she said nothing and started to pray.But her husband was severely injured too -- the shrapnel had blown out his intestines. And Um Abdou looked down to find her own legs hanging slightly from her body.The moment I saw myself I knew that my legs were going to be amputated she says.She and her husband were rushed to makeshift hospitals in the Syrian border towns of Qusair and Jousi. With the help of Syrian rebels she was carried on a stretcher all the way across the border to Lebanon amid 12 hours of shelling and shooting. Her husband died en route.Um Abdous children are now buried in a plot of land in Syria owned by the state. Her husband was buried in the cemetery in Jousi because it was too dangerous to take him back to his hometown.Even the dead have no right to be buried she says.Um Abdou has undergone four operations in Lebanon including the two amputations. Her parents and sisters are looking after her and she displays the green red white and black flag of the Syrian revolution in her room.She knows the pain will be unbearable the day she goes back to Syria and visits the place where her family is buried. In the meantime she has written a poem in the hospital.I lost my children and husband but my soul is still strong it reads. I will keep saying until my last breath long live freedom.___________________BAGHDAD Iraq � The gang of masked gunmen broke into the small apartment near Damascus where Waleed Mohammed Abdul-Wahid and his family had lived for nearly three years. Are you Sunni or Shiite? they shouted as his three children began to cry.We are Sunnis! answered his wife Wasan Malouki Khalaf.Do you know any Shiites who are cooperating with the Syrian government? the gunmen demanded.We do not know any such people she said. We are from Baghdad.The gunmen left. The brief but terrifying invasion sealed the decision Abdul-Wahid had been mulling for weeks: to leave behind an increasingly violent life in Syria and return to Iraq.More than 2 200000 people fled Iraq during the war and sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shiite Muslims and almost half of them ended up in neighboring Syria. Now Syria is plagued with the same sectarian conflict and many of the same people are on the run a second time. At least 22000 Iraqi refugees are thought to have left Syria to return to Iraq despite the dangers they thought they had left behind.Abdul-Wahid had worked as a deliveryman back in Baghdad bringing cylinders of cooking gas to both Shiite and Sunni neighborhoods. Militants kidnapped him outside his Sunni-dominated neighborhood of Azimiyah in 2009 and tortured him for four days. His arms still show the burn scars.The family packed up and fled to Syria where they built a new life in a mostly Shiite suburb. The children settled down in school and the United Nations gave them food and an income. Abdul-Wahid 49 found a job in construction and started taking medication for the severe depression he had suffered after the kidnapping.Then the uprising against Assad began and violence returned to Abdul-Wahids life. Mortars bombarded their neighborhood and snipers shot at people in the streets. The last straw was the gunmen storming their home in late July and asking his daughter if she was Sunni or Shiite.She did not reply because she does not know the meaning of such a question Abdul-Wahid says.The bus fare from Damascus to Baghdad cost about $110 for each person. Abdul-Wahid had to ask his brother for money he says his eyes filling up with tears of sadness and shame. His family is living in a room in his brothers house.I have lost everything now he says. I am jobless and penniless...I am even afraid of going outside my brothers house. Now I have to start from zero.He plans to go back to Syria when � or if � the violence ebbs. Wasan his wife says the shortages of electricity and water in Iraq are unbearable as is the lack of good medical care security and jobs.But Abdul-Wahid is doubtful the violence will end any time soon or Assad will be ousted from power.I think that the armed struggle in Syria will continue for a long time he says. He is clinging to power...I think that he will survive.__________________ZAATARI Jordan � At this Syrian refugee camp opened in the desert just two months ago anger sizzles in the scorching sun.It is anger at being crowded with about 32000 other people onto a parched treeless strip of land where the day is too hot and the night is too cold. But it is also a murderous anger among the Sunni Muslims here against the Shiites back home whom they blame for the war. Many Sunnis oppose Assads ruling regime which is Alawite an offshoot of Shiite Islam.When I return I will kill any Shiite I see with my dagger. I will chop him to pieces shouts Basel Baradan a bitter 18-year-old farmer who fled the southern town of Daraa with his family in July. He is weeping.Jordan now hosts an estimated 200000 Syrians including those not registered with the U.N. -- the largest number of refugees taken in by any neighboring country. After months of delay Jordan finally opened its first official refugee camp in July at Zaatari near the border with Syria.Already about 30000 refugees live at the camp and they keep coming. This poor desert nation says it can no longer afford to welcome Syrian refugees into its towns and houses.So they live apart at Zaatari and they grow angrier. Late Monday dozens of furious refugees hurled stones and injured about 26 Jordanian policemen demanding better camp conditions or their return home.Baradans father Ghassan 50 also a farmer says that with the ubiquitous dust snakes scorpions and swings in temperature living at Zaatari is a worse struggle than Assads missiles falling on our heads back home. He too is angry and blames Shiites under Assad for killing Sunnis.Baradan lived most of his life exchanging visits and sharing meals with Shiite neighbors. But he grew increasingly resentful in recent years because he thought the Shiites were getting more food and money and were supported by Iran a Shiite Muslim nation.Sunni Muslims have no respect in Syria and we fled here to find ourselves confined to this dirty prison he sighs puffing on his cigarette under a once-white tent yellowed from the desert sun and heat.The thirst for revenge that is palpable at the Zaatari camp does not bode well for Syrias future.Baradans tent is marked with the Arabic scribbling Get out Assad. Outside a group of young Syrians lines up to fill buckets with drinking water. One of them Mohammad Sweidan 17 wears a green T-shirt with an Arabic emblem that reads: Proud Sunni.Shiites and Alawites are not Muslims he says. They should be killed because they are infidels who are killing the Sunnis the true believers and followers of Islam.Under Baradans tent his 46-year-old wife says she worries about ending up stateless like Palestinian refugees displaced in wars with Israel. She cries as she cooks lunch on a small gas stove.I never thought we would become refugees like them says the woman who calls herself Um Basel after her eldest son in keeping with conservative Muslim tradition. Her husband interrupts. Even the Israelis do not treat the Palestinians the way Assad is treating Sunnis in Syria.In a corner Basel too is crying as he gazes at video on his cellphone of his 9-month-old nephew Rabee left behind in Daraa with his family.What is keeping me going is this video he says tearfully. I cant wait to see Rabee again. I miss him dearly._____________________CAIRO Egypt � Syrian refugee Mohammad B.s passport expired a few weeks ago making official what he has long known: He no longer has a country.The 26-year-old had nowhere to renew his passport. The Syrian embassy in Cairo was closed after protests. The embassies in Libya and Tunisia had switched loyalty to the opposition and could no longer issue passports. And the embassy in Algeria simply told him to go back to Syria.That was not an option.In Syria Mohammad had been studying to become an English teacher. He fled in May 2011 after he was shot in Daraa the birthplace of the uprising. The bullet pierced his upper lip broke his teeth ripped through his cheekbone and exited near his temple. The deep jagged wound identified him as an anti-government protester which in Syria marked him for death.At first all the protesters wanted was a new mayor and better amenities. Mohammad was hopeful.I didnt want to leave my country I wanted it to get better says the soft spoken young man with a ponytail and a right eye that droops slightly from his wound. He uses only his first name because he fears for the safety of his parents both government employees in Daraa.On April 25 the military clamped off the main road into Daraa. Then he says security forces started firing into the crowd of about 50 people with large machine guns.A bullet sliced Mohammads lip. He waved his hands for help and a car came to his aid. A cellphone video he was shooting at the time seen by The Associated Press records the sound of a hail of bullets popping off the metal.It was very painful Mohammad recalls. I thought: Today is my last day....And the driver thought I was dead.When he got home his family fled to hide with relatives in the countryside. He stayed in bed for a week unable to eat. Then he made the most difficult decision of his life: He had to leave Syria immediately.He had never left Syria before. He chose Egypt because he would not need a visa and knew a friend there.Egypt does not share a border with Syria and only about 1700 Syrian refugees have registered there according to the United Nations refugee agency. However the agency estimates the real number is closer to 95000.Mohammads family gave him about $1000 in cash all they could spare. He put on dark sunglasses wrapped a headdress over his face and prayed all the way to the airport. The bus passed a gauntlet of 25 checkpoints.At the airport he was detained for questioning but slipped interrogators a $300 bribe. He headed for his plane sure he would be back.Instead he is still in Cairo with no money. He lives in a rundown apartment where eight people share three rooms.With the help of a German-based aid group Mohammad has had four operations for his face. His doctor says he will need more.In February one of Mohammads five brothers made his way to Egypt via Jordan. Bashar 21 suffers from psychological problems after being shut in the house for a year watching the violence on TV. His presence both helps and hurts Mohammad.I feel like I have a family but on the other hand it made my life more difficult Mohammad said. He doesnt work.Mohammad cannot legally work or study either. But he is teaching Arabic and translating for journalists. He also is considering starting a Web-based service to collect videos photos and other documentation of the rebellion from citizens back home.He talks with his family in Syria most days by phone or Skype. They never discuss politics. Since he left security forces have gone to his house twice looking for him.I am worried all the time about my family and friends he says. When I check on them I just want to know they are still there.Above all Mohammad longs to go home study and have a good career. None of that is possible while he is stranded in Egypt with an expired passport.I just want to stop this bloodbath he says. I dont know how.Mroue reported from Tripoli Lebanon Yacoub and Jakes from Baghdad Iraq Marjorie Olster from Cairo Egypt and Jamal Halaby from Zaatari Jordan.	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	4	4	3	4	3	2	5	5
BEIRUT (AP) � Syrian warplanes bombed two buildings on Monday in the northern city of Aleppo killing at least five people including three children from the same family activists said.The Britain-based activist group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the death toll could very well rise with more people feared to be buried under the rubble of the two destroyed buildings.Aleppo-based activist said Mohammed Saeed said the raid came before dawn. He added that the aim behind such strikes on residential areas is to terrify the people and try to turn them against the Free Syrian Army rebel group.The regime wants people to say that had the Free Syrian Army not entered the city the regime wouldnt have bombed us Saeed said.The fight for Aleppo a city of 3 million that was once a bastion of support for President Bashar Assad began in late July and is critical for both the regime and the opposition. If it falls to the opposition it would be a major strategic victory in the civil war giving fighters a stronghold in the north near the Turkish border. A rebel defeat at the very least would buy Assad more time.Activists say nearly 30000 people have already died in the uprising against Assads rule that began 18 months ago inspired by the other revolts around the Arab world against authoritarian rulers.The Observatory the Local Coordination Committees another activist group said the airstrikes on the southern neighborhood of Maadi destroyed the targeted buildings. An amateur video showed people digging through a pile of rubble in search of survivors.Fighting and shelling have been a daily occurrence in Aleppo Syrias largest city and commercial capital since late July when rebels attacked it and took over several neighborhoods. Repeated attacks by government troops to regain control of the areas have so far been unsuccessful.The battle for Aleppo has marked the first time that the regime has used helicopters and warplanes regularly to strike from the air bringing an even heavier toll of civilian casualties than before when military forces relied heavily on often indiscriminate artillery and tank shelling.The Observatory said five people were killed in the latest airstrikes while the LCC said eight died. The LCC said the dead included three children from the same family. Rami Abdul-Rahman who heads the Observatory said the death toll could rise with more people feared buried under the rubble.The Observatory and the LCC reported violence elsewhere in the country including attacks by government troops backed by helicopter gunships on the southern town of Sheikh Miskeen in Daraa province.The Observatory said rebels and troops were fighting near the military air base of Tabaqah in the northern province of Raqqa. Last week rebels captured a major border crossing with Turkey in Raqqa.The latest attacks came as the U.N.s top human rights body prepared to vote on a resolution next week that would condemn abuses in Syria call for perpetrators to be held accountable and extend the mission of a U.N. expert panel which has been collecting evidence of possible war crimes and crimes against humanity.The draft resolution was submitted to the U.N. Human Rights Council on Friday by Arab countries including Morocco Jordan Libya Saudi Arabia Tunisia and Kuwait. It is likely to receive a majority in the 47-nation council when it goes to a vote at the end of next week.The Geneva-based council received a report earlier this month from the Commission of Inquiry it appointed to investigate abuses in Syria. The panel reported that an increasing number of foreign elements including Islamic militants are now operating in Syria. The panel also submitted a confidential list of Syrian officials who it said could be prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity.___Associated Press writer Frank Jordans contributed to this report from Berlin.	4	3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	2	4	2	2	4	3
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada is likely to have added a modest 10000 new jobs in September backpedaling from gains in August that far surpassed market expectations and better reflecting the sluggish pace of the countrys economic growth.The gain of 10000 jobs was the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 23 economists. The most bullish forecast was for 28000 new jobs and the most bearish was for a loss of 15000 jobs.In August Canada added 34300 jobs - more than doubling expectations and recouping all the 30400 positions lost in July - but analysts see slower and steadier jobs growth as more in line with economic fundamentals.If we look at the last six months even the six-month average which is about 27000 that looks high for an economy thats growing at less than 2 percent said Avery Shenfeld chief economist at CIBC who expects 10000 new jobs.So were due for a somewhat slower pace.The polls median forecast for the unemployment rate in September was 7.3 percent unchanged from August and July.Jobs growth was muted in May and June after a whopping 140500 new jobs were created in March and April which was the biggest two-month spree of job creation in more than 30 years.We expect a see-saw performance from the labor market in September as another strong gain in jobs (like that in August) is not likely given the current economic environment IHS Global Insight Canadian economists Arlene Kish and Jillian Kohut wrote in a research note.They forecast a loss of 15000 jobs but added: There is the potential for a gain given that consumer confidence levels increased in September but we havent always seen survey responses reflected in actual data outcomes.Canada has regained all the jobs it lost during the last recession which was milder in Canada than it was in the United States.(Editing by Peter Galloway and Jeffrey Hodgson)	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	1	2	1	1	1	3
Its safe to say that the Democrats are pretty happy with where things stand in the presidential race and that President Obama would rather be in his own electoral shoes than Republican challenger Mitt Romneys. With a short six weeks left until the election Romneys campaign is struggling to reboot after a disastrous few weeks Obama holds a slim but steady lead in most national polls his electoral-college advantage is even more formidable and as New York Times stats whiz Nate Silver points out history is in Obamas corner at this point in the race. Some Democrats are even declaring victory � Mitt Romneys not going to be president of the United States House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Sept. 16. I think everybody knows that. Yikes! says Matt Miller at The Washington Post. Yes Romneys had a week from hell but its far too early for Democrats to pop open the champagne. Are Obama and his surrogates getting a little overconfident?Team Obama has every reason to be confident: Could anything still happen in this race? Sure says Nate Cohn at The New Republic but its getting harder to think up plausible scenarios in which Romney wins. A strong challenger might mount an unprecedented comeback against an incumbent but combine Romneys notable weakness as a candidate Obamas just-under-50-percent poll numbers and the fact that almost all voters have made up their minds and a Romney victory just doesnt seem like its in the cards.Romneys chances are in jeopardySEE MORE: Is beer Obamas secret campaign weapon?Actually Chicago is terrified of complacency: None of that matters if Obama voters take his apparent advantages for granted � and fail to show up on Election Day says Amy Gardner at The Washington Post. Thats the scenario that keeps Obamas campaign chiefs up at night. Complacency is a special threat to Obama because his election strategy relies on a vast field operation so if his politically attuned staffers believe the torrent of media coverage suggesting Romney is toast there goes Obamas voter-registration and get-out-the-vote advantage.Obama campaign redoubling efforts amid fears of voter complacencyOne candidate is cocky but its not Obama: Republicans were � and are � right to see this as a winnable election says Jamelle Bouie at The American Prospect but Im increasingly convinced that the Romney campaign is beset by a clueless overconfidence. How else to account for Romneys failure to move toward the center and his passive faith that a weak economy is enough to beat an incumbent president except that hes bought into the Rights fantasy that Obama is a lightweight and weakling.

(Reuters) - The maker of the Nabi tablet computer for children sued Toys R Us Inc on Monday saying the worlds largest toy retailer stole trade secrets in preparing to introduce the rival Tabeo tablet this month.The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Diego California seeks to stop Toys R Us from selling Tabeo ahead of the all-important holiday season. Nabi creator Fuhu Inc contends that Toys R Us agreed to become the exclusive seller of the Nabi last year to learn product secrets before bringing Tabeo to market.The introduction of Tabeo heated up the market for tablets designed specifically for children which also includes players like LeapFrog Enterprises Incs LeapPad.Fuhu accused Toys R Us of fraud breach of contract unfair competition and trade secret misappropriation. Fuhu also said that Toys R Us copied Nabis butterfly-shaped bumperwhich is used to help protect the tablet for Tabeo.According to the lawsuit Toys R Us agreed in October 2011 to become the exclusive Nabi distributor but in the end did virtually no promotion and only ordered for the holiday season a little more than what Toys R Us said could be sold in one day.The companies ended their exclusive agreement in January.Fuhu said in the lawsuit that the reason for Toys R Uss behavior did not become clear until it introduced Tabeo this month.Toys R Us used Fuhus trade secrets and confidential information to start selling Tabeo which systematically attempts to replicate the Nabi experience far earlier than Toys r Us could have done otherwise if at all the lawsuit said.Aside from the order to stop selling Tabeo Fuhu is asking that any Tabeos be turned over to Fuhu. It is also seeking unspecified monetary damages.A spokeswoman for Toys R Us said the company could not comment on the lawsuit as it has yet to have an opportunity to review it.The case is Fuhu Inc v Toys R Us Inc Case.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - British explorer Tullow Oil Plc and its Canadian partner Africa Oil Corp started drilling a third well in Kenya extending a campaign to discover more reserves after finding oil in the east African country earlier this year.Drilling of the well known as Paipai-1 and located in northern Kenyas Marsabit County started on Saturday. Its planned total depth is 4112 metres and it could have as many as 121 million barrels of crude oil Africa Oil said. Tullow hopes the well will encounter oil rather than gas.A discovery at Paipai would extend the producing plays of Sudan into Kenya and open a potentially significant and new petroleum province within Kenya Keith Hill Africa Oils chief executive said in a statement.East Africa has become a hotbed of exploration after several petroleum discoveries in the area pushed the region into the international limelight. However Kenya has yet to determine whether it has commercially viable quantities of hydrocarbons.Paipai-1 on onshore Block 10A is a joint venture of Tullow the well operator with 50 percent of the exploration license Africa Oil holding 30 percent and London-listed Afren with the remaining 20 percent.Tullow is already drilling one other well in Kenya known as Twiga-1 on Block 13T about 30 kilometres west of where it made its oil discovery in March. Hill said the results of this well are expected before the end of October.The British company also was a venture partner in the offshore well Mbawa-1 that encountered gas. However Mbawas operator Apache Corp said it had hoped to find oil and there was insufficient gas to justify costly investments in liquefied natural gas facilities and pipelines.If Tullow finds oil for a second time in Kenya it may spur investment in infrastructure projects such as a refinery and pipeline to its coastal ports.Kenyas energy minister Kiraitu Murungi said he thought the country had enough petroleum to warrant both projects.We are becoming the new Middle East Murungi said at a press conference in August.Tullow indicated it would be at least a year before it knows whether its March discovery can be extracted and exported.	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	1	1	1	3

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obamas administration took a big step on Thursday toward terminating a 16-year-old tomato trade agreement with Mexico following a request from growers in Florida an important swing state in the presidential election.The decision surprised Mexican officials and tomato producers who have offered to renegotiate the pact. They argue the 1996 agreement has benefited U.S. consumers and brought stability to the North American market.Florida growers who traditionally compete with Mexico for the U.S. winter and early spring tomato market have pressed the Obama administration since June to terminate the pact.Many U.S. agricultural and business groups weighed in favor of keeping the current pact out of fears the dispute could spark a tomato trade war that would have collateral damage on other commodities.An end to the agreement would clear the way for U.S. growers to seek anti-dumping duties that could lead to higher prices for Mexican tomatoes sold in the United States.Todays preliminary decision is welcome news to domestic growers and the workers who have suffered under an outdated and failed agreement governing trade in fresh tomatoes with Mexico Reggie Brown executive director of the Florida Tomato Exchange said in a statement.Mexican growers export about $1.9 billion worth of tomatoes to the United States. They say Florida producers have failed to keep pace with technology changes that have produced a tastier Mexican tomato and propelled sales in the United States.Francisco de Rosenzweig a senior Mexican Economy Ministry official said Mexicos government was very surprised by the decision particularly as it came one day before a long-awaited meeting between Mexican growers and the Commerce Department.Its very unfortunate that they issued a preliminary decision against us first before sitting down with the Mexican producers de Rosenzweig told Reuters.Martin Ley a spokesman for Mexican producers said they would put forth a strong proposal in the Friday meeting with U.S. officials which they still hope will lay the foundation for a new pact.Mexicos Economy Minister Bruno Ferrari told Reuters earlier this week it was obvious the Florida Tomato Exchange had timed its request to put political pressure on the White House ahead of the November 6 presidential election he said.Florida is one of several battleground states expected to determine the outcome of the Nov 6 election where Obama is running against Republican challenger Mitt Romney.The U.S. Commerce Department stopped short of immediately tearing up the agreement as Florida growers requested in June.But it took a preliminary position in favor of ending the pact and said it would make a final decision as soon as practicable and in no longer than 270 days.While we would have preferred that todays announcement would have ended the fight the preliminary decision ratifying the domestic industrys position will help reverse the downward spiral the industry has been facing Brown said.The existing pact is called a suspension agreement because the Commerce Department suspended an anti-dumping investigation against Mexico in 1996 and negotiated a minimum price at which Mexican tomatoes can be sold in the United States.Florida growers complain the agreement fails to protect them against Mexican tomatoes sold below the cost of production. Ditching the agreement would allow Florida producers to file for new tariffs.U.S. distributors of fresh produce sided with Mexico in the dispute calling the notice of intent to terminate the agreement a slap in the face to the Mexicans and noting that thousands of jobs in border states rely on the tomato importing business.The Fresh Produce Association of America accused Washington of acting hastily on political motives and said numerous U.S. industry groups had lobbied to uphold the tomato agreement.Even Walmart the biggest retailer in the world supported keeping the tomato suspension agreement said Lance Jungmeyer president of the group said.(Reporting By Doug Palmer Additional reporting by Adriana Barrera in Mexico City Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrew Hay)	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	2	3	2	3
RABAT (Reuters) - The United Nations special rapporteur said on Saturday torture against people suspected of national security crimes in Morocco was systematic and urged the country to quickly end ill treatment in its prisons and police detention centers.At the end of a rare fact-finding mission at the invitation of Moroccan authorities Juan Mendez told reporters there was also evidence of torture being inflicted on people held in prisons and detention centers in the disputed Western Sahara which Rabat controls.Treatment amounting to torture appears in Morocco during large demonstrations a perceived threat to national security or terrorism Mendez told a news conference.Torture tends to be much more cruel harsh and systematic in national security issues.He said torture was not as common as it used to be during the past decades but noted his preliminary findings showed cases of credible reports of punches application of electric shocks and cigarette burns.In addition I have good reason to believe there were credible allegations of sexual assault threats of rape of the victim or family members and other forms of ill-treatment he told the news conference attended by relatives of jailed activists and plain clothed policemen.A spokesperson for the official National Council of Human Rights (CNDH) who attended Mendez press conference declined to comment on his findings.Government spokesman Mustafa el-Khalfi could not immediately be reached for comment.The U.N. investigator also denounced a rise in severe beatings sexual violence and other forms of ill-treatment on undocumented migrants many of whom flock from sub-Saharan Africa to Morocco in the hope of moving illegally into Europe.CRIMINALHe urged Rabat to ratify as soon as possible the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture known as Opcat that aims to prevent mistreatment of people in detention.Mendez will submit his findings and recommendations coupled with the Moroccan governments responses to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva in February.Torture is a criminal offence in Morocco but no official has publicly stood trial for crimes involving torture.Mendez said Rabat may need to amend the definition of torture to bring the offence in line with international law.U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said earlier this month Morocco a staunch U.S. ally in North Africa could be a regional model after it managed to contain Arab Spring protests with reforms.But she urged Rabat to reform the courts make government more open and respect human rights.Last week U.S.-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) urged Morocco to investigate accusations police tortured pro-democracy activists to force false confessions.(Reporting By Souhail Karam Editing by Sophie Hares)	2	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	2	2	4	3
MADISON Wis. (AP) � If theres one thing that can unite political foes in Wisconsin it just may be the Green Bay Packers.Republican Gov. Scott Walker who made a national name for himself by going after public employee unions last year posted a message on Twitter calling for the return of the NFLs locked-out unionized officials after a disputed call led to a Seattle Seahawks 14-12 victory over the Packers on Monday night.After catching a few hours of sleep the (hash)Packers game is still just as painful. (hash)Returntherealrefs Walker tweeted early Tuesday.Democratic state Sen. Jon Erpenbach who was one of 14 Democrats who fled to Illinois for three weeks last year in opposition to Walkers union proposal said he saw the irony in Walkers post but in Wisconsin were all fans first and foremost.If you were born and raised in Wisconsin you were raised on the Packers Erpenbach said. Every Sunday its Packers and pancakes not necessarily in that order.The NFL locked out the officials in June after their contract expired. The league has been using replacement officials and through three weeks of the regular season there has been much criticism over the way some games are being handled.Walkers spokesman Cullen Werwie tried to spin the governors post on Tuesday saying it wasnt meant as a pro-union political statement. Walkers tweet was being widely mocked on Twitter in light of his push last year that effectively ended collective bargaining for teachers nurses and most other public workers.I dont think this anything to do with unions but has everything to do with refs making bad calls Werwie said.Erpenbach was so incensed over the game that around midnight Monday night he tweeted two different public phone numbers for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and urged people to call and voice their displeasure.I could never ref an NFL football game ever Erpenbach said. The replacement refs are doing the best they can do out there but the commissioner doesnt want this to sink to a World Wrestling Federation-type event on Sunday. They have to do something. It calls into question the integrity of the game.While Erpenbach himself plans to leave a message for Goodell urging an end to the referee labor dispute he wont be advising the Packers to employ the same tactics he and the other Democratic senators did last year.I would not recommend the Packers get on a bus and leave the state he said.	3	3	2	4	3	3	3	4	4	1	3	3	1	2	3
ROME (Reuters) - The head of Italys Left Ecology and Freedom party is to run as a candidate in the primary to pick a centre-left candidate for prime minister in next years national election.Nichi Vendola governor of the southern region of Puglia and Italys only openly homosexual senior politician has helped the SEL party carve a niche as a leftwing alternative to the main centre-left Democratic Party (PD).PD leader Pier Luigi Bersani and Matteo Renzi the mayor of Florence are the main candidates in the race to head a centre-left coalition expected to take place at the end of November.Vendolas announcement came amid talk of a second term for Prime Minister Mario Monti who has said he will not run in the election but would be available to serve if no clear government emerged from the vote expected in April.To drive out the fantasy of an encore for Monti and to transform the primaries from the umpteenth party feud into an opportunity for change in this country ... I accept the challenge to win it Vendola said.An opinion poll from SWG last week estimated Vendolas share of the ballot among likely voters in the centre-left primary as 7 percent compared with 60 percent for Bersani and 30 percent for Renzi.SELs support in the overall electorate stood at 5.4 percent the same poll found.(Reporting By James Mackenzie Editing by Dan Lalor)	3	3	3	2	2	3	2	3	3	1	2	2	2	2	2
Early-bird skywatchers on Wednesday (Oct. 3) will be treated to a rather extraordinary sight when the most brilliant planet passes exceptionally close to one of the brightest stars in the sky.The planet is Venus and the star is Regulus in the constellation of Leo the Lion. The celestial pair promises to dazzle observers before dawn on Wednesday weather permitting.Venus is by far and away the brightest morning star and is currently the focal point of the eastern dawn sky. It will in fact remain this way all through the balance of the autumn season. Venus rises a bit more than three hours before sunrise � that�s even before the first light of dawn.In the days and weeks to come early risers can take note of the fact that Venus will slowly be appearing lower and a bit less brilliant in the night sky. Even now the planet appears ever so slightly lower and less dazzling than it did September but this astonishingly bright planet is still positioned almost as well as it can be for a predawn apparition. [Octobers Night Sky Sights (Sky Maps)]At present Venus glows just to the west (right) of the famous backwards question-mark pattern of stars known as the Sickle of Leo and is poised above and to the right of Leos lucida � its brightest star � the bluish first magnitude star Regulus. But because Venus is moving at just over a degree per day to the east the space between them will rapidly close in the coming mornings. (Your closed fist held at arms length covers about 10 degrees of the sky.)On Wednesday morning as viewed from the U.S. East Coast Venus will slide as little as 7.5 minutes of arc to the south of Regulus. To give you some idea of how small this is it is only one-fourth the apparent width of a full moon or one-eighth of a degree.By the time Venus and Regulus have risen for the West Coast the gap separating the two will have widened to 12 minutes of arc. That�s equal to the separation between Mizar and Alcor the double star that marks the bend in the handle of the Big Dipper. Astronomy guides often state that if you can spy Alcor next to the brighter Mizar without optical aid that you have normal vision.But seeing Regulus so close to Venus on Wednesday morning may be more of a challenge because of Venus overpowering brilliance. Binoculars will no doubt prove to be a great assistance in viewing this as Venus is now shining at magnitude -4.1 compared to bluish Regulus at magnitude +1.3 (the lower the number the brighter the object). Converting this 5.4-magnitude difference into a ratio we find that Regulus � one of the 21 brightest stars in the sky � shines only 1/158th as bright as Venus!Editors note: If you snap an amazing photo of Venus and Regulus and youd like to share for a possible story or image gallery send image and details (including location info) to managing editor Tariq Malik at tmalik@space.com.Joe Rao serves as an instructor and guest lecturer at New Yorks Hayden Planetarium.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Inspired by travel sites like Expedia start-up Wiresurfer.com is promising to condense three days work into fifteen minutes for small companies shopping for telecommunications services.The Coral Springs Florida based company is launching its website on Tuesday where small and medium sized businesses can compare prices for telephone and Internet services and see what promotions are on offer in their region.Businesses can then order their service via Wiresurfer which has signed up about fifteen telecom partners including AT&T Inc Comcast CenturyLink Inc EarthLink Inc and Windstream Corp.The idea is that choosing a telecom provider would be made as easy as booking a flight online.Wiresurfer Chief Executive and co-founder Jeff Kaufman expects big demand for a service that makes procuring telecom services less time consuming.Small businesses often have to spend up to three days trawling through the websites of multiple phone companies and then calling the companies individually to find the best deals he said.The process of actually shopping for telecommunications services even at the small business level is complex said Kaufman Its a giant time suck.The phone companies have agreed to pay Wiresurfer a portion of each customers phone bill for the duration of their contract with payments ranging from 14 percent to 25 percent of the phone bill Kaufman said.With a target market of 50 million U.S. small businesses Kaufman said he hopes to break even about eight months after launch and to have over 16000 customers within about 30 months.In the meantime the company said it has an angel investment of $200000 from Nantucket based entrepreneur Alan Bankart. It is also seeking a round of venture capital funding.If the service takes off then the business telecom services market could potentially become more competitive according to Gartner analyst Tiffani Bova who follows technology and telecom sales channels around the world.If you look at other industries that have had an online marketplace aggregate multiple suppliers they have resulted in creating a much more competitive market Bova said referring to the travel hotel and insurance industries.Even though telecom contracts come up for renewal only once every year or two Bova argued that even if Wiresurfer gains just a small part of the market it could have a solid business.Theres lots of room here the analyst said.(Reporting By Sinead Carew Editing by Tim Dobbyn)	4	4	4	4	3	3	2	3	3	3	3	2	3	1	3
BANGKOK (AP) � World stock markets turned lower Thursday after weak Japanese trade figures and a contraction in Chinese manufacturing underlined that the global economy continues to struggle.The Japanese data showed that the countrys powerhouse export sector was continuing to suffer the effects of a slowdown in Europe and elsewhere. Exports in August totaled 5.05 trillion yen ($64.33 billion) down 5.8 percent from a year earlier. Imports were also down. Exports to Europe sank 28 percent.The economic news from China wasnt any better. A private survey of manufacturers showed that activity fell again in September though at a slightly slower pace than August.European stocks fell in early trading. Britains FTSE 100 shed 0.7 percent to 5849.66. Germanys DAX slipped 0.3 percent to 7370.29 and Frances CAC-40 lost 0.4 percent to 3518.15.Wall Street futures also fell. Dow Jones industrial futures lost 0.3 percent to 13462 while S&P 500 futures slid 0.3 percent to 1448.80.The losses in Asia were more acute. Japans Nikkei 225 index dropped 1.6 percent to close at 9086.98. South Koreas Kospi shed 0.9 percent to 1990.33 and Hong Kongs Hang Seng lost 1.2 percent to 20590.92. Benchmarks in Singapore Taiwan and Indonesia also fell. New Zealands bucked the trend and rose.In mainland China the Shanghai Composite Index tumbled 2.1 percent to 2024.84 the lowest closing in more than three years. The Shenzhen Composite Index lost almost 3 percent to 840.21.Asian stocks had rallied a day before after the Bank of Japan announced an aggressive monetary easing program in an attempt to spur growth and counter the strength of the Japanese yen.But the market impact of the Bank of Japans move was short-lived a possible sign that investors are getting stimulus-weary. The move came days after the U.S. Federal Reserve revealed it will purchase an average of $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities a month until the economy shows significant improvement.Andrew Sullivan principal sales trader at Piper Jaffray in Hong Kong said in an email that it was disappointing that the initial rally on the BOJ stimulus did not hold.Markets also didnt get much encouragement from the release of preliminary manufacturing data out of China for September. The HSBC Flash Purchasing Managers Index stood at 47.8 for the month out of a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 indicate contraction.Still the figure was an improvement over Augusts 47.6 level suggesting that the slowdown may be stabilizing.It showed the decline has slowed down said Francis Lun managing director of Lyncean Holdings in Hong Kong. The problem is with Europe and America. Except for the iPhone nothing is selling.Japanese export stocks took a beating as the yen bounced back from a brief drop sparked by the central banks announcement Wednesday. Mazda Motor Corp. plummeted 4.8 percent and Yamaha Motor Co. lost 3.8 percent. Sony Corp. shed 4.6 percent.Australian surf wear retailer Billabong International plunged 7.3 percent after saying that a private equity firm that had been looking to make a takeover bid for company had pulled out.Benchmark oil for October delivery was down 54 cents to $91.44 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract for crude fell $3.31 to finish at $91.98 per barrel on the Nymex on Wednesday.In currencies the euro fell to $1.2970 from $1.3063 late Wednesday in New York. The dollar fell to 78.22 yen from 78.39 yen.	3	3	3	3	4	3	2	3	2	2	2	1	1	1	3
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook Inc and most of its adversaries in a raft of lawsuits over its $16 billion initial public offering can agree on at least one thing: that the cases should be heard in a New York court.At a hearing on Thursday lawyers for both sides asked a judicial panel to pool together dozens of lawsuits against the social networking company in Manhattan federal court. The panel made no immediate ruling but did not question the idea of grouping the cases in New York.In at least 33 lawsuits seeking class-action status Facebook investors have asked courts to hold the company and its underwriters responsible for causing them losses in the IPO in May. Investors say they lost money due to technical glitches on the Nasdaq stock market and accuse the company of selectively disclosing unflattering information about its business prospects to Wall Street analysts who then shared it with privileged investors.Facebooks IPO was one of the most hotly anticipated in recent memory but the technical malfunctions embarrassed the company and the NASDAQ. The lawsuits which seek unspecified damages could cost Facebook millions of dollars to defend as it strives to put the IPO problems behind it.While lawsuits have been also been filed in California Florida and Washington D.C. most plaintiffs and the defendants say the cases should proceed in New York because witnesses evidence relating to the IPO and the underwriter banks are all in that city.Were glad to be in New York and wed like to stay here Andrew Clubok a lawyer for Facebook told the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation at the hearing in Manhattan federal court.The only lawyer to speak against consolidation of the cases represented plaintiffs in two derivative lawsuits currently before a federal judge in San Francisco. Those suits seek to hold Facebooks board and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg responsible for damage they claim was done to the company.The derivatives plaintiffs say the litigation should take place in California state court near Facebooks headquarters for easy access to witnesses and documents.The 11-judge multidistrict panel which meets periodically to decide where wide-ranging litigation should be consolidated is expected to issue a decision within weeks. Seven judges were present for Thursdays hearing.Most of the cases are in New York already and have been added to the docket of Manhattan federal judge Robert Sweet ever since he was randomly assigned the first complaint.There may be a good chance that Judge Sweet could get this case panel Judge Paul Barbadoro of New Hampshire said prompting laughs from the crowded courtroom.Facebook has said that it did not violate any rules and that Nasdaq was to blame for trading glitches on its first day of trading.NASDAQ OMX Group Inc is also facing investor lawsuits that claim it was negligent in failing to execute trades in the face of record-breaking volume during the IPO.William Slaughter an attorney for NASDAQ told the judges on Thursday that the exchange agreed those cases should also be before Judge Sweet but that they should proceed on a separate track from the Facebook lawsuits.The two sets of actions ... really dont have much in common he said.The case is In Re: Facebook Inc IPO Securities and Derivative Litigation U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation No. 12-md-2389.(Reporting By Basil Katz Editing by Martha Graybow and Alden Bentley)	2	2	2	3	2	4	3	3	3	2	2	2	3	2	4
