PARIS (Reuters) - Doubts are growing over the resilience of a Franco-German shareholder pact at the heart of EADS   placing a new timebomb under $45-billion European merger talks with British defense contractor BAE Systems  	3	1	3
EADS was born from a merger of French  German and Spanish interests in 2000 with a unique structure allowing the Paris government and Daimler to cohabit at arm's length 	2	1	1
Daimler owns a voting share of 22 5 percent of EADS 	1	2	1
Negotiations to remove the structure and merge with BAE have reached a critical point: France is unwilling to surrender official oversight of EADS  which makes both Airbus airliners and key military hardware  and Berlin has raised the stakes by demanding a state shareholding with equal rights to the French 	2	1	3
Its job: to erect a screen between the French state and a skeptical Daimler 	3	1	1
Similar to golden shares  the special shares would let Britain  France and Germany block takeovers  replacing another of the current pact's functions in protecting EADS 	2	2	1
The first fuse to pop could be a mini-pact applying solely to the French partners  which places a floor on the proportion of the French core stakes to be held by the state and Lagardere 	3	1	2
It is hard to predict what would happen next  but experts say it suggests turbulence for governments  EADS and investors 	3	1	3
Without the pact  alternative takeover defences may have to be cobbled together and France would keep a separate veto over matters relating to EADS production of nuclear missiles for the French military 	3	1	1

Antarctic Seals Survive Arrival of Massive Icebergs	1	2	1
After an enormous iceberg called B-15 broke off from Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf  it released chunks of ice — themselves massive icebergs — that wreaked havoc on emperor penguins that breed to the west 	2	1	2

As noted by Fortune on Thursday  WSJ Columnist Holman W  Jenkins  Jr  believes that Apple is slipping  The Cupertino  California-based company has historically focused on making great products but now  Jenkins opines  Apple is becoming far too focused on strategy  He cites the rejection of Google’s (GOOG) superior Maps app as one example of Apple’s missteps  but the issue will really become apparent when Apple tries to tackle TV 	3	3	3

Because competing with Apple is way too easy  Samsung finds new rival in Facebook	2	2	2
Facebook is currently home to nearly 1 billion active users each month  and photo-sharing is one of the monstrous social network’s key features  Users love sharing photos and  perhaps even more so  they love commenting on each other’s photos  How important is photo-sharing to Facebook users? So important that the company decided to spend nearly $1 billion to acquire Instagram and further bolster its photo-sharing portfolio 	1	3	1
Share Shot is by no means a useless feature  though  It is an example of an area where Samsung is trying to add value and differentiation  and for some users  it may indeed be compelling  Samsung’s focus on the feature in recent ads is part of a bigger issue  however: Samsung is not always good at telling people why they should buy Samsung phones 	1	2	2
Samsung is moving in the right direction  Its latest flagship phones like the Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II indeed offer unique features that cannot be found elsewhere  Now  finding a way to communicate the right features to the right audience looks like it will be Samsung’s next big challenge if it hopes to see continued success once carriers’ attention begins to shift elsewhere 	1	2	1

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The California man behind a crudely produced anti-Islamic video posted to YouTube that has inflamed parts of the Middle East was arrested for violating terms of his probation  authorities said Thursday 	1	1	2

The movie was made last year by a man who called himself Sam Bacile  After the violence erupted  a man who identified himself as Bacile called media outlets including The Associated Press  took credit for the film and said it was meant to portray the truth about Muhammad and Islam  which he called a cancer 	1	1	2
Many senior Conservatives are millionaires  educated at Britain's top fee-paying schools and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge 	1	1	1
BADLY TIMED TIRADE	1	1	1
The Conservatives  who have run Britain in a coalition since 2010  are behind the opposition Labour Party before a 2015 election and the Mitchell row could cut further into their public support if it lingers  analysts said 	1	1	2
"Mitchell  56  was educated at the prestigious Rugby School  home of one of the most famous literary bullies  Flashman  in the 19th-century novel ""Tom Brown's Schooldays"" by Thomas Hughes  an Oxford graduate "	1	1	1
Labour leader Ed Miliband  who also went to Oxford  compared Cameron to Flashman last year for his behaviour in parliament 	1	1	2
Labour and police groups called for an inquiry into the events at Downing Street 	1	1	1
"Although still unconfirmed  the bad language has fed into a perceptions the Conservatives have not shed the ""Nasty Party"" tag that dogged them under Margaret Thatcher and John Major in the 1980s and 1990s  Cameron has attempted to soften their policies in areas like gay rights and support for the poor "	1	1	2

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Student athletes collapsing from cardiac arrest in the middle of a game may grab headlines  but when someone's heart gives up at a school  it's usually not a youngster's 	1	1	2
Schools are community-gathering places  and two-thirds of our cases were adults  said Dr  Robert Swor  an emergency physician at Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine in Royal Oak 	1	1	1
Sixteen of the 47 cardiac arrests at schools involved minors 	1	1	2
"Every time something happens in a school like this it gets a lot of community awareness """	2	1	1
Several states require schools to have automated external defibrillators  or AEDs  on site to treat cardiac arrests 	1	1	1
The briefcase-sized devices let non-experts check a person's heart rhythm via patches glued to the chest 	1	1	1
Swor said it appeared that when they weren't used  it was often because bystanders had trouble identifying the signs of a cardiac arrest - for instance because the victim was convulsing or still gasping 	1	1	1
"Cardiac arrests ""are not common  but they are certainly more common than a school being hit by a tornado """	2	1	1
Weisfeldt added that seizing the chance to teach students CPR is not only helpful while they're in school  but might pay off down the road if they ever witness a cardiac arrest 	2	1	1

Capriles has said he wouldn't touch the government's programs and would improve what he said was their poorly administration 	1	2	2
The grainy video has been replayed for days on state television since the scandal erupted 	2	1	2
"In his speeches  Capriles has avoided name-calling  referring to his adversary as ""the government's candidate"" while chiding him for talking much and doing little "	1	1	3

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A chef who boiled his wife's body for four days to hide evidence of her death was convicted of second-degree murder Thursday 	1	1	4
The chef spoke to authorities from a hospital bed in March 2011 after leaping off an 80-foot cliff in Rancho Palos Verdes 	1	1	3
Viens  who attended his trial in a wheelchair  said in the interview that he stuffed his wife's body in a 55-gallon drum of boiling water and kept it submerged with weights 	1	1	5
He said he stashed his wife's skull in his mother's attic in Torrance 	1	1	3
Annie Dookhan  34  of Franklin  was arrested Friday in a burgeoning investigation that has already led to the shutdown of the lab  the resignation of the state's public health commissioner and the release of more than a dozen drug defendants 	1	1	2
"Verner said state police learned of Dookhan's alleged actions in July after they interviewed a chemist at the lab who said he had observed ""many irregularities"" in Dookhan's work "	2	1	1
Her next court date is Dec  3 	1	1	1
The obstruction charges accuse Dookhan of lying about drug samples she analyzed at the lab in March 2011 for a Suffolk County case  and for testifying under oath in August 2010 that she had an advanced degree from the University of Massachusetts  Attorney General Martha Coakley said at a news conference 	1	1	2
Dookhan's supervisors have faced harsh criticism for not removing her from lab duties after suspicions about her were first raised by her co-workers and for not alerting prosecutors and police 	1	1	2
Dookhan was the most productive chemist in the lab  routinely testing more than 500 samples a month  while others tested 50 to 150 	1	2	1
A lab employee saw Dookhan weighing drug samples without doing a balance check on her scale 	2	1	1
She told police she identified some drug samples as narcotics simply by looking at them instead of testing them  a process known as dry labbing 	2	1	1

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's ruling Communist Party accused disgraced politician Bo Xilai of abusing power  taking huge bribes and other crimes on Friday  sealing the fate of a controversial leader whose fall shook a leadership handover due at a congress from November 8 	2	2	3
The once high-flying Bo now faces a criminal investigation that stemmed from a murder scandal  and will almost certainly be jailed 	3	1	3
Bo's wife Gu Kailai and his former police chief Wang Lijun have already been jailed over the scandal stemming from the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood in the southwestern municipality of Chongqing  where Bo was Communist Party chief 	1	1	3
That charge appears to reflect accusations from Wang's trial that suggested Bo tried to stymie the murder investigation 	3	1	3
But the few weeks left before the congress will probably not allow time for a trial  said He Weifang  a law professor at Peking University who has closely followed Bo's downfall 	2	1	2
"Bo's ""grave violations of party discipline"" extended back to his time as an official in Dalian city and Liaoning province in northeast China  and as minister of commerce  said the statement from the Politburo "	2	1	2
Bo's son  Bo Guagua  who was a friend of the murdered Heywood  has remained largely silent throughout the fall of his parents 	2	1	2
Since Bo Xilai was ousted in March  he has not been seen in public and has not been allowed to answer the accusations against him 	1	1	1
"At a news conference days before his removal  Bo rejected as ""filth"" and ""nonsense"" the then unspecified allegations against him and his family "	2	1	2
"The twin announcements will ""significantly reduce perceived political and economic risks"" and ""help end policy paralysis "" Ting Lu  China economist Bank of America/Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong said in an emailed research note "	2	2	1
If anything  this should make markets and the general public somewhat assured that this is not really being delayed too far  Damien Ma  an analyst for the Eurasia Group who follows Chinese politics  said of the November 8 congress date 	2	2	1
His brash self-promotion irked some leaders 	2	1	2
His likely trial could still stir that ideological contention 	2	1	2
China's party-run courts rarely find in favor of defendants  especially in politically-sensitive cases 	2	1	2
"The latest party statement also said Bo ""had or maintained improper sexual relations with multiple women"" "	2	1	2
"Once a charismatic yet divisive star who stood out on China's stolid political stage  Bo is almost sure to face trial and jail eventually after the ruling Communist Party announced his expulsion on Friday and issued a list of sordid allegations: bending the law to hush up a murder  taking huge bribes  and engaging in ""improper sexual relations with multiple women """	3	2	4
DEMONISATION AND DISILLUSIONMENT	2	1	3
"Bo  63  is the ""princeling"" son of a Communist Party official who served alongside Mao Zedong "	2	1	1
He won support from the underdogs of society and the radical intellectuals  and maybe even some within the party and the military  said Lai Hongyi  who teaches about contemporary China at the University of Nottingham in Britain 	3	3	2
That charge appears to reflect accusations from Wang's trial that suggested Bo tried to stymie the murder investigation 	2	1	3
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming will visit Canada next week as Ottawa deliberates whether to approve a landmark $15 1 billion takeover of oil producer Nexen Inc by state-owned Chinese oil company CNOOC Ltd 	2	1	1

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The cheap and popular heart drugs known as beta-blockers may be overused in many patients  exposing them needlessly to bothersome side effects  a new study suggests 	2	1	2
Researchers found that people with stable heart disease who took beta-blockers were no less likely to die from their condition  or to suffer a heart attack or stroke  than were those not on the medications 	1	1	2
During an average follow-up period of 44 months  people on beta-blockers fared no better than others in any of the three groups 	1	1	2
In people with CAD  for instance  12 9 percent of those on beta-blockers either died from heart disease or had a heart attack or a stroke  That compared to 13 6 percent of those not on the drugs - a difference that could easily be due to chance 	2	1	3
"A lot of physicians still prescribe beta-blockers  especially in patients who have known CAD  said Bangalore  whose findings are published in the Journal of the American Medical Association  ""We need clinical trials to say which are the patients who would benefit from beta-blockers """	1	1	1

Congo questions Tintin's cultural status ahead of Francophonie	2	1	2
KINSHASA (Reuters) - Any Tintin fan would feel at home in the small wooden shed in a back street of Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa  where the shelves are crammed with brightly painted statues from the famous Belgian cartoon character's adventures 	2	2	1
Friendly faces are everywhere - the tufted-haired Tintin  the bearded Captain Haddock and the bumbling policemen Thomson & Thompson - lovingly carved from wood and carefully painted in bold colours 	2	3	1
But with Kinshasa preparing to receive a flood of visitors for an international summit of French-speaking countries next month  some are questioning whether Congo should turn its back on the boy journalist  whose fictional adventures in the then-Belgian colony depicts Africans as dull-witted and childish 	3	2	2
His museum is a celebration of the masks  headdresses and clothing that have played an integral part in Congo's traditional values  but few of the country's 70 million inhabitants come to visit the museum 	2	2	1

"Crossfitters don't say they visit the gym  instead they head into ""the box "" which is a Crossfit training center for the WOD or workout of the day  which is posted daily "	1	1	1

NEW YORK (AP) — A research firm estimates that Google will surpass Facebook in display advertising revenue this year  beating every other company with a 15 4 percent share of the U S  market 	1	1	1
EMarketer said it expects Google Inc  to rake in $2 31 billion of revenue from online display ads 	1	1	1
These are more lucrative than the text-based ads that appear next to search results and account for the bulk of Google's revenue 	2	2	1
The researcher predicts that Facebook Inc  will hold 14 4 percent of the market this year with $2 16 billion in U S  revenue 	1	1	1

Emmylou  Mumford & Sons team for 'CMT Crossroads'	1	1	1
NASHVILLE  Tenn 	1	1	1
(AP) — Emmylou Harris loves Mumford & Sons for a special reason 	1	3	1
She said it proves her theory that music is going to keep reinventing itself in good ways 	2	2	1
That eventually led them to the Old Crow Medicine Show and then deep immersion in old-timey sounds from America's long-neglected past 	3	1	1
They ran across Harris' imprint many times along the way  and with the help of dobro master Jerry Douglas  they help explore that legacy on the show 	2	1	1
"The band  which releases their new album  ""Babel "" this week  were a growing success story in that community when they appeared on the 2011 Grammy Awards with Bob Dylan and the Avett Brothers  launching Mumford & Sons into the national popular consciousness "	2	3	1

TUCSON  Ariz 	1	1	1
(AP) — Space shuttle Endeavour has flown over Tucson  Ariz   on its trek west to retirement in a Los Angeles museum 	1	1	1
Hundreds of people gathered on the grass mall at the University of Arizona campus to watch it pass 	1	1	1
It took off Wednesday from its old home in Kennedy Space Center in Florida 	1	1	1
This is the last flight for a space shuttle 	1	1	1
Even though it was a few seconds  it was a unique experience to witness history  said Andrew Lerner  23  of Santa Monica 	2	4	1
"Since Endeavour buzzed by some of the Golden State's most iconic sights  law enforcement and transportation authorities warned motorists not to ""gawk and drive """	2	3	2

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is stepping up a campaign to ease airline ownership restrictions around the world in a move to boost growth opportunities for its struggling carriers 	1	3	2

Brussels proposed earlier this month that the European Central Bank (ECB) take charge of supervising all banks in the euro currency zone  as a first step towards creating a banking union under which euro zone countries would eventually jointly back their lenders 	1	2	1
Legally  the European Parliament will have no say in writing much of the legislation for a banking union 	1	1	2
But it has powers to amend other important financial regulations and can exert influence to change or even delay the new regime 	1	2	2
Langen's views were echoed throughout the debate of the parliament's influential economic and monetary affairs committee  where members from around Europe voiced conflicting views about the shape of a banking union 	1	2	2
A banking union  which would aim to restore confidence in an industry that has been battered by crisis for nearly five years  has three major steps: the ECB takes over monitoring euro zone banks and others that sign up  a single fund is created to close down and settle the debts of failed banks  and a comprehensive scheme to protect savers' deposits is established 	1	1	1
We are under time pressure  said Sven Giegold  a German member of the parliament  who also flagged concerns about a two-tier scheme damaging those countries on the outside 	2	1	2
The banking union     is linked to access to the ESM 	1	1	1
"This pledge  made by euro zone leaders in June  appears to be unraveling  however  after Germany  the Netherlands and Finland drew a distinction between future banking problems and ""legacy"" difficulties - which could mean that problem banks in Spain and Ireland remain the states' responsibility "	1	1	2
This proposal is to allow for the direct recapitalization of Spanish banks because Spain doesn't want to put in a normal application (for aid)  said Langen  who is a member of the CDU  the same political party as German Chancellor Angela Merkel 	1	1	1
Nordea has its headquarters outside the euro zone in Stockholm  but has major operations in Finland  the sole Nordic country to use the common currency 	1	1	1
Countries should be lured in  tempted in - it should be made difficult for a country to refuse  said Giegold  who will play a leading role in talks about the plan 	4	2	2
Europeans invoke spirit of Ballesteros in Ryder comeback	2	2	1
MEDINAH  Illinois (Reuters) - They wore the colors loved by the late Seve Ballesteros and a silhouette of him on their sleeves  and then Team Europe rode his spirit on Sunday to the greatest Ryder Cup comeback victory ever 	2	3	1
We wanted to do it for Seve  said Englishman Luke Donald  who started Europe on their way to erasing a massive four-point deficit with a 2&1 victory over American Bubba Watson 	3	3	2

Madrid (Reuters) - Spain is ready to request a euro zone bailout for its public finances as early as next weekend but Germany has signaled that it should hold off  European officials said on Monday 	2	2	3
Bundling these together makes sense  due to the substance and also politically 	3	2	2
"Asked about the reports that Germany was urging Spain to wait  a German government spokesman told Reuters: ""Every country decides for itself "	3	2	2
"Germany isn't pushing in one direction or the other """	2	2	2
A spokeswoman for Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said she was not aware of any veto from Germany for an aid request 	3	2	3
"What we are focused on is to get the decisions of the June summit on the banking union implemented	3	2	2

European sources said EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn was to deliver a message to Spanish leaders on Monday that Brussels wants them to apply for assistance soon and will not impose onerous conditions beyond the reforms and savings measures outlined by the Spanish government 	3	2	3
"Rajoy is eager to avoid the political humiliation of conditions being imposed from outside and enforced by the ""troika"" of inspectors from the International Monetary Fund  European Commission and European Central Bank that has supervised programs for Greece  Ireland and Portugal "	3	1	2

Fish Oil Supplement Research Remains Murky	2	1	2
If you've been following the media trail on fish oil lately  you've probably been tempted to forgo the smelly capsules  A systematic review of 20 studies published last week in JAMA The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that neither eating extra helpings of fish nor taking fish oil supplements reduces the risk of stroke  heart attack or death  In June a review of studies published on behalf of the Cochrane Collaboration  an independent  not-for-profit organization that promotes evidence-based decision-making  concluded that fish oil pills fail to prevent or treat cognitive decline  And a 2011 meta-analysis by Yale University researchers debunked the idea that omega-3s alleviate depression  These proclamations run counter to what we have been told about fish and fish oil for decades  So why is the consensus changing? Is it time for us to toss out our pills for good?	3	1	3
"So  should you take fish oil pills or not? Most researchers agree that oily fish such as salmon and mackerel are far better way to get your fill of good fats  Many of the early  promising studies on omega-3s involved fish rather than fish oil pills (in one  men who were advised to eat fish were 29 percent less likely to die in the two years following a heart attack than men who were not)  and a 2010 study by Columbia University scientists reported that following a Mediterranean diet—which  among other things  is rich in fatty fish—reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease by 34 percent  ""Not only may people be benefiting from the omega-3 fatty acids in fish  but the fish may be displacing such foods as hamburgers and quiche from the diet  both high in saturated fat "" explains Alice Lichtenstein  director of the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory at Tufts University "	2	3	1
"But despite the murky science  if you don't get omega-3s from other sources—or if you have heart disease risk factors but aren't taking medications—omega-3 pills may still be a good idea  ""There's no harm in taking a fish oil supplement  and there could be benefits "" Mozaffarian says  ""The bottom line is that getting some [omega-3] is better than getting none """	2	3	2

Four Distinct  Genetic Types of Breast Cancer  Study Finds	1	1	1

Reuters reviewed more than 30 letters written by Gandhi to the prime minister and U S  diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks that portray her as passionate about social issues  and attached to protecting the poor 	3	3	2
A request to interview Gandhi was declined 	1	1	1
Sonia Gandhi  65  carries the authority of a political family that  after India won independence from Britain in 1947  drove a vision of democratic socialism to uplift the vast rural masses 	3	2	2
With that came a mind-boggling range of controls that tied the economy down and kept it closed to global markets 	3	1	4
A turning point came in 1991 when a slump in exports following the collapse of the Soviet Union and a leap in oil import costs due to the Gulf War tipped the country into a balance of payments crisis 	3	2	3
Manmohan Singh  then finance minister  responded with shock treatment  devaluing the rupee by nearly 19 percent 	3	2	3
As party president and chairperson of the ruling coalition  she has kept a low and almost enigmatic profile  appearing to stand above the political fray 	3	3	2
But Gandhi wields extraordinary power behind the scenes  shaping policy out of the public eye with a tight circle of decision-makers and relying on back-channel negotiations to manage relations with fractious coalition allies	3	3	2
Moreover  paramount political power rests with the leader of the Congress party  Sonia Gandhi  who holds no cabinet position  while the government is led by an unelected prime minister     who lacks a political base of his own 	3	2	3
Gandhi also set up the National Advisory Council  a government-funded think tank that offers legislative guidance on social policy and the rights of disadvantaged groups 	2	2	1
With Mukherjee gone from the Finance Ministry  Singh and Chidambaram made their move  warning Gandhi of a possible slump in the rupee and even a repeat of 1991  sources said 	3	1	2
Gandhi's ambition in all this is to ensure that the Congress party returns to power in 2014  with her son - Rahul - at the helm of the government after eight years waiting in the wings 	2	2	1
What she is concentrating on is really the need to be re-elected  said M J  Akbar  a former Congress party lawmaker and once a trusted Gandhi family insider 	3	1	2

"The first customers in Hong Kong were greeted by staff cheering  clapping  chanting ""iPhone 5  iPhone 5 "" and high-fiving them as they were escorted one-by-one through the front door "	1	3	1

I have this I-need-to-be-first mentality because this is the first time I'm buying an iPhone  said Liu  who is dumping her Blackberry because she believes the iPhone 5's photo and video capabilities will help with her journalism studies 	3	1	1
"Mainland Chinese  who like to shop in Hong Kong because there's no sales tax and because of the strength of the yuan  will probably buy it from the resellers ""at a higher price — a way higher price "" said Wong  who hoped to make a profit of HK$1 000 ($129) "	2	2	1

The IAEA declined to comment 	1	1	1
"Last week  Iranian nuclear energy chief Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani said ""terrorists"" might have infiltrated the Vienna-based agency "	1	1	2
He suggested the IAEA included too much sensitive information about Iran's nuclear program in its reports that he said could be used by saboteurs 	1	1	2
Western diplomats dismissed his allegations as an attempt to distract attention away from the agency's bid to gain access to a site in Iran it suspects was used for nuclear weapons research  something Tehran denies 	1	1	1
The 35-nation board of the agency censured Iran earlier this month for defying international demands to curb uranium enrichment and failing to address mounting disquiet about its suspected research into atomic bombs 	1	1	2

The upheaval in Syria presents an opportunity for the Gulf's Sunni rulers to bolster their influence and possibly leave Shiite powerhouse Iran without its critical alliances that flow through Damascus  Assad's regime is led by the minority Alawite sect  an offshoot of Shiite Islam 	1	2	1
One of the opposition groups  the National Coordination Body for Democratic Change in Syria  on Friday accused the regime of being behind the disappearance of two of its leaders 	1	1	3
The group's head  Hassan Abdul-Azim  said the regime was believed to be behind the disappearance  Openly disparaging the regime has always been taboo and fraught with danger in Syria  although some have grown emboldened because of the uprising 	2	2	3
"Abdul-Azim said the opposition wants a ""new regime that represents the will of the people "" He said his group will go ahead with the conference  The gathering will invite European ambassadors and envoys from China and Russia "	1	2	1

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast will abolish a 20-year-old tax break given to local cocoa grinders when the 2012/13 season starts on October 1  an official with the top grower's marketing board told Reuters on Saturday  in a victory for exporters who don't grind locally 	1	1	1

Japan posts $9 6B August trade gap as exports wilt	1	1	2
Meanwhile  the country's energy imports have risen following closures of most of its nuclear plants 	1	1	1
Japan's central bank  which on Wednesday announced it would boost the size and duration of a government bond-buying program to spur growth  forecast little change in the immediate future 	2	1	1
Though the deficit for August was lower than the more than 800 billion yen that some analysts had forecast  prolonged weakness in Europe and recent friction with China  Japan's biggest overseas market  suggest the trade gap will likely persist in coming months 	2	1	2
Exports to Europe dived 28 percent in August from a year earlier to 484 9 billion yen ($6 2 billion) while exports to Asia — Japan's biggest overseas market — sank 6 7 percent overall to 2 84 trillion yen ($36 2 billion) 	1	1	2
They fell 9 9 percent from a year earlier to 966 3 billion yen ($12 3 billion)  the Finance Ministry reported 	1	1	1

Review: 3-D makes beautifully bleak 'Dredd' pop	1	2	1
"The action extravaganza from director Pete Travis and writer Alex Garland  based on the cult-favorite British comic series ""2000 A D  "" offers a fully realized world with both intensity and tension  But after about an hour the claustrophobia of it all — the dreary  concrete sameness and the overpowering electronic score — feels smothering and grows tiresome  Maybe that's the point  though: to wear us down "	2	2	2
"The visceral visuals  shot in 3-D by Oscar-winning ""Slumdog Millionaire"" cinematographer and frequent Lars Von Trier collaborator Anthony Dod Mantle  feature extreme close-ups and sequences of super-cool slow-motion photography  which wisely are spread sparingly throughout the course of the picture  A guy doesn't just get shot in the face — we see the bullet enter his mouth and send blood spurting out his cheek through the screen in such deliberate  distinct fashion  you can practically count the drops "	2	3	1
(For the uninitiated  Dredd is actually much funnier than this description makes him sound  his terse  deadpan responses to the most absurdly graphic and depraved situations provoke many of the biggest laughs )	2	2	1
"Olivia Thirlby  best known for indies and comedies like ""Juno "" has a calm yet confident presence as the rookie Judge Anderson  who happens to have been assigned to Dredd for training upon one particularly bloody day  Her psychic abilities make her an asset when things get especially chaotic  and her slightly ethereal nature provides a welcome complement to Dredd's intense groundedness  She also serves as our emotional guide to a world that's essentially emotionless  aside from fear "	2	2	1
"Hardcore fans of the comic who hated the jokey 1995 ""Judge Dredd "" starring Sylvester Stallone as the title character and featuring Rob Schneider  won't just be relieved to see this incarnation  They'll be downright giddy "	2	2	2

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's administration took a big step on Thursday toward terminating a 16-year-old tomato trade agreement with Mexico following a request from growers in Florida  an important swing state in the presidential election 	2	2	2
Today's preliminary decision is welcome news to domestic growers and the workers who have suffered under an outdated and failed agreement governing trade in fresh tomatoes with Mexico  Reggie Brown  executive director of the Florida Tomato Exchange  said in a statement 	3	3	2
They say Florida producers have failed to keep pace with technology changes that have produced a tastier Mexican tomato and propelled sales in the United States 	2	3	2
It's very unfortunate that they issued a preliminary decision against us first before sitting down with the Mexican producers  de Rosenzweig told Reuters 	3	1	3
